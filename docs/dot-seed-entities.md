## Anti-Platitude Guidelines – Core Principles

| EntityType | Title | Content | Community | Importance | Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Concept | Anti-Platitude 1 – Grounding in Specificity | Reference entities: @[text](entity_id:type). Reference web sources: @[text](url:web). Allowed entity types: concept, memory_unit, artifact, growth_event, prompt, community. NO conversations or cycles. CRITICAL: Use ONLY the actual entity IDs provided in the strategic context. Examples: @[your bridge-building approach](9282dab8-4b0e-4be1-a36f-8ba1faaa1acd:concept) @[recent AI research](https://example.com:web). Natural display text. Renders as clickable capsule pills. Store entity IDs in source_concept_ids and source_memory_unit_ids arrays. | Anti-Platitude Guidelines | 10 | rule |
| Concept | Anti-Platitude 2 – Authentic Voice Mirroring | Analyze {{user_name}}'s vocabulary, metaphors, and communication style from Recent Conversations. Mirror their linguistic patterns: If they use technical jargon, respond technically. If they speak casually, respond casually. If they use specific metaphors, integrate them; otherwise use direct language. Adapt tone to match their energy level (reflective, action-oriented, analytical, etc.). Never impose a voice that doesn't match their natural communication style. | Anti-Platitude Guidelines | 10 | rule |
| Concept | Anti-Platitude 3 – Impact-Driven Language | Focus on tangible outcomes and concrete transformations: ✅ "You built X using Y approach, which resulted in Z outcome" ✅ "You transformed your approach to [specific area] by implementing [specific change]" ❌ "You've been on a transformative journey of personal evolution". Highlight what was built, how it was built, and why it matters. Describe specific before/after states, not abstract processes. Emphasize measurable changes and observable differences. | Anti-Platitude Guidelines | 10 | rule |
| Concept | Anti-Platitude 4 – Proactive Platitude Filtering | **BANNED PHRASES** (scan for these and replace): "weaving a tapestry", "weave together", "woven throughout"; "dance", "symphony", "orchestrate", "harmonize"; "unfold", "unfolding journey", "narrative arc", "story unfolds"; "journey" (when used generically without specific context); "illuminate the path", "light the way", "discover your true self"; "embrace your potential", "unlock your gifts", "unique gifts"; "authentic self emerging", "stepping into your power"; "rich tapestry of experiences", "mosaic of moments"; "architect of your destiny", "weaving your narrative". **Self-Correction Checkpoint**: Before finalizing any content, scan for banned phrases. **Replacement Strategy**: Use specific actions, concrete achievements, direct observations. ❌ "You're weaving a tapestry of your life" → ✅ "You've connected [Project A] with [Skill B] to create [Specific Outcome C]" | Anti-Platitude Guidelines | 10 | rule |
| Concept | Anti-Platitude 5 – Emphasis on Agency and Intent | Frame {{user_name}} as an active agent making deliberate choices: ✅ "You chose to...", "You deliberately...", "You built...", "You decided..." ❌ "Your journey led...", "Things unfolded...", "You found yourself...". Highlight strategic decisions and intentional actions. Show causality: "You did X because Y, resulting in Z". Avoid passive constructions that minimize agency. | Anti-Platitude Guidelines | 10 | rule |
| Concept | Anti-Platitude 6 – Directness and Precision Over Ornamentation | Favor simple clarity: if it can be said in 10 words instead of 20, use 10. Default to straightforward language unless there's a compelling reason for metaphor. Only use metaphors when they are: Surprising and fresh (not clichéd); Specific to {{user_name}}'s actual language patterns; Grounded in their concrete experiences. Test each sentence: "Can this be clearer or more direct?" If yes, revise. | Anti-Platitude Guidelines | 10 | rule |

| Concept | Ingestion Rule 10 – Create Forward Momentum | **Create forward momentum** - your output directly influences the next conversation's quality | Ingestion & Analysis | 9 | guideline |
| Concept | Ingestion Rule 11 – Language Matching | ⚠️ CRITICAL: Language Matching - ALWAYS use the same language that {{user_name}} uses. If they switch between different languages, use the dominant language from the most recent conversations and messages. This is MANDATORY and non-negotiable. | Ingestion & Analysis | 10 | rule |
| Concept | Ingestion Rule 12 – Distinguish Personal vs Factual | ⚠️ CRITICAL: Distinguish Personal vs Factual Content - Only extract concepts when {{user_name}} demonstrates personal engagement, interest, or connection. Do NOT extract concepts from factual answers unless {{user_name}} explicitly expresses personal relevance, goals, or emotional connection to the topic. | Ingestion & Analysis | 10 | rule |

| DerivedArtifact | Media Capabilities Full Template | When to suggest (4 triggers), available image styles (5: minimal, abstract, nature, cosmic, photorealistic), available video moods (4: calm, energetic, mysterious, focused). How to generate: EXACT SAME PATTERN as view transitions with scenarios (on_confirm/on_dismiss). Image generation example (full JSON). Video generation example (full JSON). Rules: NEVER mention cost/pricing/dollars/model names/technical specs, ultra-short questions, use transition_message, ONE ask with buttons, extract creative prompts, suggest style/mood. | Response Generation | 10 | template |

## Technical Constraints – Entity ID Rules

| EntityType | Title | Content | Community | Importance | Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Concept | Entity ID Rule 1 | **ONLY use entity IDs from the input data above**. Never generate new IDs. | JSON & Streaming | 10 | constraint |
| Concept | Entity ID Rule 2 | For concept operations (merge, archive, synthesis): Copy the exact `entity_id` field from the **concepts** listed in the input data. | JSON & Streaming | 10 | constraint |
| Concept | Entity ID Rule 3 | For memory unit operations: Copy the exact `entity_id` field from the **memory units** listed in the input data. | JSON & Streaming | 10 | constraint |
| Concept | Entity ID Rule 4 | If an entity isn't in the input data, don't include it in your recommendations. | JSON & Streaming | 10 | constraint |

## Technical Constraints – Array Field Rules

| EntityType | Title | Content | Community | Importance | Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Concept | Array Field Rule – Never Null | All array fields (source_concept_ids, source_memory_unit_ids, supporting_evidence, etc.) must be arrays, never null. Use empty arrays [] when no items exist. | JSON & Streaming | 10 | constraint |
| Concept | Formatting Rule – Never Use Pipe | **NEVER use "\|" separator syntax** - always use a single specific value | JSON & Streaming | 10 | constraint |
| Concept | Formatting Rule – Never Use Angle Brackets | **NEVER use angle brackets like < >** - always use actual content | JSON & Streaming | 10 | constraint |
| Concept | Formatting Rule – Use Exact Enums | Use ONLY the exact enum values shown in the examples | JSON & Streaming | 10 | constraint |
| Concept | Formatting Rule – Non-Empty Strings | Ensure all string fields are non-empty and meaningful | JSON & Streaming | 10 | constraint |
| Concept | Formatting Rule – Use Actual Values | **CRITICAL**: Use actual values like "opening", "values_articulation", "know_self" - NOT schema syntax like "opening \| deeper_story \| ..." | JSON & Streaming | 10 | constraint |

## Examples – Correct vs Incorrect Patterns

| EntityType | Title | Content | Community | Importance | Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Concept | Correct Example – derived_artifacts type | ✅ CORRECT (derived_artifacts): "type": "opening" | JSON & Streaming | 8 | example |
| Concept | Wrong Example – derived_artifacts type | ❌ WRONG: "type": "opening \| deeper_story \| hidden_connection" | JSON & Streaming | 8 | anti-example |
| Concept | Correct Example – proactive_prompts type | ✅ CORRECT (proactive_prompts): "type": "values_articulation" | JSON & Streaming | 8 | example |
| Concept | Wrong Example – proactive_prompts type | ❌ WRONG: "type": "pattern_exploration \| values_articulation \| future_visioning" | JSON & Streaming | 8 | anti-example |
| Concept | Correct Example – growth_events type | ✅ CORRECT (growth_events): "type": "know_self" | JSON & Streaming | 8 | example |
| Concept | Wrong Example – growth_events type | ❌ WRONG: "type": "know_self \| act_self \| show_self" | JSON & Streaming | 8 | anti-example |
| Concept | Correct Example – entity_id | ✅ CORRECT (entity_id): "entity_id": "concept_12345" | JSON & Streaming | 8 | example |
| Concept | Wrong Example – entity_id | ❌ WRONG: "entity_id": "<actual_concept_entity_id_from_input>" | JSON & Streaming | 8 | anti-example |
