# 2D1L Dashboard Design Proposal

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 26, 2025  
**Status:** Implemented

## Executive Summary

The 2D1L dashboard has been redesigned from a placeholder to a comprehensive, philosophy-driven interface that helps users maximize value from their experiences. The new design embodies the **3x2 Growth Matrix** (Know|Act|Show × Self|World) and the core principle of **"就地取材因材施教"** (Use Local Materials, Teach According to Aptitude).

## Core Philosophy Alignment

### **The Reflected Self as Growth Catalyst**

The dashboard serves as both a **reflective mirror** and a **growth catalyst**, helping users:

1. **See themselves clearly** through their growth data and patterns
2. **Move forward meaningfully** across all six dimensions using accessible resources
3. **Bridge inner awareness with world contribution** through contextualized guidance

### **Six-Dimensional Growth Model Integration**

The dashboard visualizes and tracks progress across the complete growth journey:

- **Know-Self**: Deep reflection, pattern recognition, self-awareness
- **Know-World**: Understanding external knowledge and frameworks
- **Act-Self**: Personal agency, skill development, capability building
- **Act-World**: Service to others, collaborative action, contribution
- **Show-Self**: Authentic self-expression, personal narrative development
- **Show-World**: Public sharing, teaching, inspiring others
