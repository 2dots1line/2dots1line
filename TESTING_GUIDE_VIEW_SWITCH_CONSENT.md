# Testing Guide: View Switch with User Consent

**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Ready for Testing  
**Feature**: Simplest Scenario - Chat â†’ Cosmos View Switch with Two-Button Consent Pattern

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step testing instructions for the new engagement-aware dialogue feature. The backend and frontend are both complete and ready for end-to-end testing.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend (Completed âœ…)
- View-specific instructions for Chat view with `switch_to_cosmos` suggestion
- Enhanced prompt template with engagement guidelines and `ui_action_hints` schema
- PromptBuilder loads and renders engagement-aware instructions
- DialogueAgent parses `ui_action_hints` and maps to `ui_actions`

### Frontend (Completed âœ…)
- ChatInterface displays inline pill buttons ("Yes"/"Maybe later") with glassmorphic design
- Action handler executes view switching and stores proactive greeting
- CosmosScene checks for and displays proactive greeting
- Full integration with streaming dialogue workflow

## Test Environment Setup

### 1. Start All Services

```bash
cd /Users/danniwang/Documents/GitHub/202506062D1L/2D1L

# Start Docker services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Start PM2 processes
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

# Start web-app dev server
cd apps/web-app
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Verify Services

```bash
# Check Docker containers
docker ps

# Check PM2 processes
pm2 status

# Check web-app is running on http://localhost:3000
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Flow - Cosmos-Appropriate Question

**Objective**: Verify agent detects cosmos-appropriate question and suggests view switch with buttons

**Steps**:
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Open Chat interface (full or medium size)
3. Send message: _"I wonder what my cosmos is shaping right now"_
4. **Expected**:
   - Agent responds with text that includes a question like: _"Should we go to Cosmos view together?"_
   - Two inline pill buttons appear after the question: **[Yes]** (green) and **[Maybe later]** (gray)
   - Buttons have glassmorphic styling (semi-transparent, blur effect)
   - Green "Yes" button glows on hover
   - Gray "Maybe later" button also has hover effect

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Agent's response includes natural question about switching views
- [ ] "Yes" button is green with glassmorphic style
- [ ] "Maybe later" button is gray with glassmorphic style
- [ ] Both buttons have hover effects (scale + glow)
- [ ] Buttons appear inline with text, not as a separate block
- [ ] Buttons do not overlap with other UI elements

**Console Logs to Check**:
```
ðŸ”€ DialogueAgent - View switch suggestion generated: [...]
ðŸŽ¬ ChatInterface: Received ui_actions: [...]
```

### Scenario 2: User Confirms - View Switch + Proactive Greeting

**Objective**: Verify "Yes" button triggers view switch and displays proactive greeting

**Steps**:
1. Complete Scenario 1 to get the buttons
2. Click **"Yes"** button
3. **Expected**:
   - View immediately switches to Cosmos (`/cosmos` route)
   - Cosmos scene loads
   - Console shows proactive greeting retrieval
   - Greeting is logged (and should be displayed in chat if chat is open)

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Clicking "Yes" triggers view switch to Cosmos
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] Cosmos loads successfully
- [ ] Proactive greeting is retrieved from sessionStorage
- [ ] Greeting includes context from earlier conversation (e.g., "As I mentioned, let me walk you through...")

**Console Logs to Check**:
```
ðŸ”˜ ChatInterface: User confirmed action: {...}
ðŸ”˜ ChatInterface: Stored proactive greeting: ...
ðŸ”˜ ChatInterface: Switching to view: cosmos
ðŸŒŒ CosmosScene: Found proactive greeting: ...
```

**Note**: Currently, the proactive greeting is logged to console. Full chat integration in Cosmos view can be added in a follow-up iteration.

### Scenario 3: User Dismisses - "Maybe Later"

**Objective**: Verify "Maybe later" button dismisses suggestion without switching

**Steps**:
1. Complete Scenario 1 to get the buttons
2. Click **"Maybe later"** button
3. **Expected**:
   - Buttons remain (or could be hidden with additional logic)
   - View does NOT switch
   - Conversation continues in Chat view
   - User can continue asking questions

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Clicking "Maybe later" does NOT switch views
- [ ] User remains in Chat view
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] User can send another message normally

**Console Logs to Check**:
```
ðŸ”˜ ChatInterface: User dismissed action suggestion
```

### Scenario 4: No Suggestion - Unrelated Question

**Objective**: Verify agent does NOT suggest view switch for unrelated questions

**Steps**:
1. Open Chat interface
2. Send message: _"What's the weather like today?"_
3. **Expected**:
   - Agent responds to question normally
   - NO buttons appear
   - Response does not include view switch suggestion

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Agent responds to unrelated question
- [ ] No "Yes"/"Maybe later" buttons appear
- [ ] Response is natural and helpful
- [ ] No view switch suggestion in response

**Console Logs to Check**:
- Should NOT see: `ðŸ”€ DialogueAgent - View switch suggestion`
- Should NOT see: `ðŸŽ¬ ChatInterface: Received ui_actions`

### Scenario 5: Multiple Cosmos-Appropriate Questions

**Objective**: Verify agent doesn't force suggestions too frequently

**Steps**:
1. Send: _"Tell me about my cosmos"_
2. (Agent suggests, user dismisses with "Maybe later")
3. Send another cosmos-related question: _"How are my memories connected?"_
4. **Expected**:
   - Agent may or may not suggest again (uses LLM judgment)
   - Agent prioritizes answering the question
   - If suggestion appears, it feels natural, not forced

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Agent doesn't suggest view switch for EVERY cosmos question
- [ ] Suggestions feel natural and helpful, not mechanical
- [ ] Agent answers user's actual question first
- [ ] Maximum 1-2 suggestions per response

### Scenario 6: Streaming + Buttons

**Objective**: Verify buttons appear smoothly after streaming completes

**Steps**:
1. Send cosmos-appropriate question
2. Watch streaming behavior
3. **Expected**:
   - Response text streams naturally
   - Buttons appear AFTER streaming completes
   - No visual glitches or button flickering
   - Buttons don't cause layout shift

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Text streams smoothly first
- [ ] Buttons appear after streaming ends
- [ ] No layout shift when buttons appear
- [ ] No flickering or visual glitches
- [ ] Timing feels natural

## Additional Testing

### Edge Case: Multiple Actions (Future)

If agent returns multiple `ui_actions` (not typical for this simple scenario):
- [ ] Multiple button sets appear
- [ ] Each set is visually separated
- [ ] All buttons work independently
- [ ] No UI overlap or collision

### Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Buttons have appropriate `aria-label` attributes
- [ ] Buttons are keyboard accessible (Tab to focus, Enter/Space to activate)
- [ ] Focus visible state is clear
- [ ] Screen reader announces button purpose

### Responsive Testing

- [ ] Buttons display correctly in full-size chat
- [ ] Buttons display correctly in medium-size chat
- [ ] Buttons display correctly (or are hidden) in mini chat
- [ ] Buttons don't break layout on mobile viewport

### Error Handling

- [ ] If backend fails to return ui_actions, no buttons appear (graceful degradation)
- [ ] If view switch fails, error is logged but app doesn't crash
- [ ] If proactive greeting is missing, Cosmos still loads normally

## Debugging

### Backend Logs

Monitor DialogueAgent and PromptBuilder:

```bash
pm2 logs dialogue-service --lines 100
```

Look for:
- `ðŸ”€ DialogueAgent - View switch suggestion generated:`
- `PromptBuilder - formatViewContext`
- `DialogueAgent - parseLLMResponse`

### Frontend Logs

Open browser console and filter by:
- `ChatInterface`
- `CosmosScene`
- `ðŸ”˜` (action buttons)
- `ðŸŒŒ` (cosmos scene)

### Check sessionStorage

```javascript
// In browser console after clicking "Yes"
sessionStorage.getItem('proactiveGreeting')
```

Should contain the greeting text.

### Check Response Structure

Add breakpoint or console.log in `ChatInterface.tsx` line ~426:

```typescript
if (response.ui_actions && response.ui_actions.length > 0) {
  console.log('ðŸŽ¬ Full response:', response);
  console.log('ðŸŽ¬ UI Actions:', response.ui_actions);
}
```

Expected structure:
```json
{
  "ui_actions": [{
    "action": "switch_view",
    "question": "Should we go to Cosmos view together?",
    "buttons": [
      {"label": "Yes", "value": "confirm"},
      {"label": "Maybe later", "value": "dismiss"}
    ],
    "payload": {
      "target": "cosmos",
      "proactiveGreeting": "Nice to see you again. As I mentioned...",
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  }]
}
```

## Known Limitations (Future Enhancements)

1. **Proactive Greeting Display**: Currently logs to console. Full integration with chat in Cosmos view requires:
   - Chat store method to add system message
   - Auto-open chat modal in Cosmos
   - Or display greeting as toast notification

2. **Button Dismissal**: Clicking "Maybe later" doesn't currently hide the buttons. Could add state management to remove buttons on dismiss.

3. **Voice Command**: No voice support yet for "Yes"/"Maybe later" responses.

4. **Preferences**: No "Always allow" or "Don't ask again" preferences yet.

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful if:

1. âœ… Agent detects cosmos-appropriate questions in Chat view
2. âœ… Agent phrases suggestion as natural question
3. âœ… Two inline pill buttons appear with glassmorphic design
4. âœ… "Yes" button triggers view switch to Cosmos
5. âœ… Proactive greeting is stored and retrieved in Cosmos
6. âœ… "Maybe later" button dismisses without switching
7. âœ… Agent doesn't suggest for unrelated questions
8. âœ… Streaming + buttons work smoothly together
9. âœ… No console errors or visual glitches
10. âœ… Build passes and app runs without errors

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **User Feedback**: Test with real user interactions, gather feedback on:
   - Button placement (feels natural?)
   - Question phrasing (sounds conversational?)
   - Timing (not too frequent?)

2. **Expand to More Views**: Add engagement-aware instructions to:
   - Cosmos view (suggest cosmos quest, focus entity)
   - Cards view (suggest opening cards)
   - Dashboard view (suggest insights)

3. **Add More Action Types**:
   - `start_cosmos_quest` - Immersive guided tour
   - `open_card` - Open specific cards
   - `focus_entity` - Focus camera on entities

4. **Full Proactive Greeting Integration**:
   - Display greeting in chat modal in Cosmos
   - Or show as toast notification
   - Maintain context continuity

5. **Analytics**: Track metrics:
   - Suggestion acceptance rate
   - Most common action types
   - User engagement patterns
