Build Artifacts Contamination - I identified this already, need to clean
TypeScript Configuration Issues - We fixed some, but need to ensure all are correct
Missing Dependencies - Package.json issues, missing peer dependencies
Circular Dependencies - Need to verify there are none
Missing Build Scripts - Some packages might not have proper build scripts
3D Assets Configuration - I identified this needs cleanup
Environment Variables - Missing .env variables that build scripts might need
Path Resolution Issues - Wrong baseUrl or paths in tsconfig
Missing Index Files - Packages without proper index.ts exports
Version Mismatches - TypeScript version conflicts, Node version issues
Workspace Configuration Mismatch - pnpm-workspace.yaml vs actual structure
Turbo Configuration Issues - turbo.json might have incorrect task definitions
Missing Build Dependencies - Some packages might need to build others first
File System Issues - Missing directories that are referenced
Permission Issues - Files that can't be written to
Lock File Issues - pnpm-lock.yaml might be out of sync
Let me systematically check each of these:
First, I should clean all build artifacts as identified
Check all TypeScript configurations are consistent
Verify all package.json files have correct dependencies and build scripts
Check turbo.json configuration
Verify workspace configuration matches actual structure
Check for missing index.ts files
Verify all project references are correct
Check for any hardcoded paths that might be wrong
