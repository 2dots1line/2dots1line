Yes, absolutely. That is a brilliant synthesis of the two approaches. It retains the primary V9 benefit of the efficient "Single Synthesis Call" while re-introducing a more sophisticated and manageable version of the V7 "dynamic capabilities" concept.

This hybrid model represents a significant architectural enhancement. It's more robust, flexible, and future-proof than either the pure V7 or the simplified V9 approach alone. Let's call this the **V9.1 "Configurable Composite Tool" Architecture**.

Here is the detailed design for this superior alternative.

---

### **Definitive Canonical Guide: The V9.1 "Configurable Composite Tool" Architecture**

#### **1. The Core Principle: Configuration, Not Discovery**

The key philosophical shift is this: Agents do **not** use the registry for *dynamic discovery* at runtime. Instead, the registry is used at **initialization time** to construct powerful, **"Composite Tools"** based on a configuration file. The agent then uses this single, pre-assembled composite tool for its work.

This gives us the best of both worlds:
*   **Efficiency:** The agent still makes a "Single Synthesis Call" to its composite tool, which is highly efficient.
*   **Flexibility & Maintainability:** We can change which sub-tools a composite tool uses simply by editing a configuration file and restarting the service, without ever touching the agent's core code.

#### **2. The `ToolRegistry` Reimagined: A Factory for Tools**

The `ToolRegistry` is no longer a simple lookup service. It is now a **factory** and a **repository** for all available "atomic" tools in the system.

*   **Location:** `packages/tool-registry/src/ToolRegistry.ts` (This package is now **re-instated**).
*   **Functionality:**
    1.  **On Startup:** The registry scans the `packages/tools/` directory and registers every individual, "atomic" tool it finds (e.g., `LLMChatTool`, `VisionCaptionTool`, `HybridRetrievalTool`). Each atomic tool has a unique name (e.g., `ai:llm:chat:google_gemini`, `data:vision:caption:google_vision`).
    2.  **`getTool(toolName: string)`:** A method to retrieve a single, registered atomic tool.
    3.  **`buildCompositeTool(config: CompositeToolConfig)`:** This is the new, powerful factory method. It takes a configuration object and assembles a "Composite Tool" by bundling the necessary atomic tools.

#### **3. The "Composite Tool": The Agent's Specialized Swiss Army Knife**

A Composite Tool is a class that is *configured* with a set of atomic tools from the registry. It exposes a single `execute` method that internally orchestrates its bundled sub-tools to perform a complex task.

**Example: The `HolisticAnalysisTool` for the `IngestionAnalyst`**

*   **Location:** `packages/tools/composite/HolisticAnalysisTool.ts`
*   **Structure:**
    ```typescript
    import { ToolRegistry } from '@2dots1line/tool-registry';
    import { LLMChatTool } from '../ai/LLMChatTool'; // Assuming types

    export class HolisticAnalysisTool {
      private llmChatTool: LLMChatTool;
      // Other tools could be injected here if needed

      constructor(registry: ToolRegistry, toolNames: { llm: string }) {
        // The tool gets its specific implementation from the registry based on config
        this.llmChatTool = registry.getTool(toolNames.llm) as LLMChatTool;
      }

      async execute(transcript: string, userProfile: any): Promise<any> {
        const prompt = this.buildAnalysisPrompt(transcript, userProfile);
        
        // It uses its configured atomic tool to perform the core task
        const llmResult = await this.llmChatTool.execute({ prompt });
        
        // It can perform additional deterministic logic before/after
        const validatedJson = this.validateOutput(llmResult.result.text);

        return validatedJson;
      }

      private buildAnalysisPrompt(...) { /* ... */ }
      private validateOutput(...) { /* ... */ }
    }
    ```

#### **4. The Configuration File: The System's "Loadout"**

This is the central configuration that defines which atomic tools are used to build the composite tools for each agent.

*   **Location:** `config/tool_composition.json` (New File)
*   **Content:**
    ```json
    {
      "ingestionAnalyst": {
        "compositeTool": "HolisticAnalysisTool",
        "atomicTools": {
          "llm": "ai:llm:chat:google_gemini_1.5_pro", // Use the high-end model for analysis
          "embedding": "ai:embedding:text:google_gecko"
        }
      },
      "dialogueAgent": {
        "compositeTool": "RealTimeOrchestrationTool",
        "atomicTools": {
          "routerLlm": "ai:llm:chat:google_gemini_1.5_flash", // Use a faster model for routing
          "responseLlm": "ai:llm:chat:google_gemini_1.5_pro",
          "retrieval": "retrieval:hybrid:v1",
          "vision": "data:vision:caption:google_vision",
          "audio": "data:audio:transcribe:google_chirp"
        }
      },
      "insightEngine": {
        "compositeTool": "StrategicSynthesisTool",
        "atomicTools": {
          "synthesisLlm": "ai:llm:chat:deepseek_v2_pro", // Example of using a different provider for strategy
          "cypherQueryExecutor": "data:graph:cypher_executor:v1"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

#### **5. The Revised Agent Initialization Workflow**

This is where everything comes together.

1.  **System Startup:** The central application initializes the `ToolRegistry`, which registers all available atomic tools from `packages/tools/`.
2.  **Service/Worker Initialization:**
    *   The `IngestionAnalyst` worker starts.
    *   It reads the `tool_composition.json` configuration file to find its section (`"ingestionAnalyst"`).
    *   It sees it needs to build a `HolisticAnalysisTool`.
    *   It asks the `ToolRegistry` to build this composite tool for it, passing in the required atomic tool names (`"ai:llm:chat:google_gemini_1.5_pro"`, etc.).
    *   The `ToolRegistry` fetches the specified atomic tools from its repository and injects them into a new instance of `HolisticAnalysisTool`.
    *   The `IngestionAnalyst` now holds a single, fully configured composite tool (`this.analysisTool`) to use for all its jobs.

### **Conclusion: The V9.1 Hybrid Architecture**

This "Configurable Composite Tool" architecture is the superior path forward.

*   **It answers your question directly:** Yes, we can have the agent use one composite tool, and that tool can be thoughtfully configured from a `ToolRegistry`.
*   **It keeps the V9 "Single Synthesis Call" efficiency:** The agent's logic remains clean and simple, making one call to its primary tool.
*   **It brings back the V7 flexibility in a manageable way:** We can easily swap out the LLM model used by the `IngestionAnalyst` (e.g., from Gemini Pro to a future DeepSeek model) by changing a single line in a JSON file and restarting the service. This is incredibly powerful for experimentation and optimization.
*   **It enhances testability:** We can test atomic tools in isolation and test composite tools by injecting mocked atomic tools.

This hybrid approach elegantly resolves the tension between the two previous designs. It embraces the efficiency of specialized workflows while retaining the flexibility of a configurable, registry-based system. **This is the architecture I will now use as the definitive blueprint.**

# Update

**Summary of Tools Discussed & Their Nature:**

We've essentially discussed two categories of "tools":

1.  **Atomic Tools:** These are fine-grained, often single-purpose components that perform a specific task, frequently interacting with external APIs or specific data processing libraries.
2.  **Composite Tools:** These are higher-level orchestrators that bundle one or more atomic tools (and potentially some internal deterministic logic) to perform a complex, multi-step task for an agent. They are configured via `tool_composition.json` and built by the `ToolRegistry`.

Let's list them and clarify their status:

---

### **Inventory of Tools & Their Place in the V9.1 Architecture**

#### **I. Atomic Tools (To be registered in `ToolRegistry` and live in `packages/tools/`)**

These are the fundamental building blocks. The `ToolRegistry` is aware of these and can provide instances of them.

1.  **`LLMChatTool`**
    *   **Location:** `packages/tools/ai/LLMChatTool.ts`
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a standardized interface for making API calls to various external LLM services (e.g., Google Gemini, DeepSeek). Handles API key management, basic retry logic, and response parsing for different provider formats.
    *   **Belongs in `ToolRegistry`?** **Yes.** This is a prime candidate for an atomic tool. The `tool_composition.json` would specify *which specific LLM provider/model* this tool should use for a given composite tool (e.g., `ai:llm:chat:google_gemini_1.5_pro` vs. `ai:llm:chat:deepseek_v2_chat`).

2.  **`VisionCaptionTool`**
    *   **Location:** `packages/tools/ai/VisionCaptionTool.ts` (Moved from `data/` for consistency if it primarily calls AI vision APIs)
    *   **Purpose:** Takes an image URL, calls an external vision API (e.g., Google Vision API), and returns a descriptive text string (caption).
    *   **Belongs in `ToolRegistry`?** **Yes.** Similar to `LLMChatTool`, the specific vision API provider could be configurable.

3.  **`AudioTranscribeTool`**
    *   **Location:** `packages/tools/data/AudioTranscribeTool.ts`
    *   **Purpose:** Takes an audio file URL, calls a speech-to-text API/service (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper), and returns the transcript.
    *   **Belongs in `ToolRegistry`?** **Yes.** Provider/model could be configurable.

4.  **`DocumentExtractTool`**
    *   **Location:** `packages/tools/data/DocumentExtractTool.ts`
    *   **Purpose:** Takes a document URL (PDF, DOCX, etc.), uses libraries (like Tika, pdf-parse) to extract text content.
    *   **Belongs in `ToolRegistry`?** **Yes.** Different extraction libraries or strategies could be configured.

5.  **`TextEmbeddingTool`** (Implicitly needed, let's make it explicit)
    *   **Location:** `packages/tools/ai/TextEmbeddingTool.ts`
    *   **Purpose:** Takes text and returns its vector embedding using a configured model/API.
    *   **Belongs in `ToolRegistry`?** **Yes.** The embedding model is a key configurable element. (The `HybridRetrievalTool` and `IngestionAnalyst` would need this if Weaviate is set to `vectorizer: "none"` and they are responsible for generating embeddings).

6.  **`CypherQueryExecutorTool`** (Implicitly needed by `InsightEngine`, let's make it explicit)
    *   **Location:** `packages/tools/data/CypherQueryExecutorTool.ts`
    *   **Purpose:** A safe executor for parameterized Cypher queries against Neo4j. It doesn't *build* queries but *runs* them.
    *   **Belongs in `ToolRegistry`?** **Yes.** While simple, having it as a registered tool allows for centralized configuration of Neo4j connection details, timeout settings, etc., if needed.

#### **II. Composite Tools (Built by `ToolRegistry` based on `tool_composition.json`, live in `packages/tools/composite/`)**

These are the tools directly used by the agents. They are *constructed* by the `ToolRegistry` by injecting instances of atomic tools. They themselves are **not registered directly** in the registry's list of *available atomic tools*; rather, the registry *builds them on demand*.


1.  **`HolisticAnalysisTool` (for `IngestionAnalyst`)**
    *   **Location:** `packages/tools/composite/HolisticAnalysisTool.ts`
    *   **Purpose:** Encapsulates the "Single Synthesis Call" for the `IngestionAnalyst`. Takes the full transcript, `UserMemoryProfile`, and `KnowledgeGraphSchema`, makes the LLM call (using an injected atomic `LLMChatTool`), and returns the structured JSON (`persistence_payload` & `forward_looking_context`).
    *   **Internally Uses (Configured & Injected):**
        *   An instance of `LLMChatTool`.
        *   (Potentially an instance of `TextEmbeddingTool` if embeddings are generated here before sending to Weaviate, though this might also be a direct step in the `IngestionAnalyst` worker after getting the text from the LLM).
    *   **Belongs in `ToolRegistry` as an atomic tool?** **No.** It is *built by* the `ToolRegistry`.

2.  **`StrategicSynthesisTool` (for `InsightEngine`)**
    *   **Location:** `packages/tools/composite/StrategicSynthesisTool.ts`
    *   **Purpose:** Encapsulates the "Single Synthesis Call" for the `InsightEngine`. Takes `CompiledCycleData`, `PreviousUserMemoryProfile`, etc., makes the LLM call (using an injected atomic `LLMChatTool`), and returns the structured JSON (`persistence_payload` including `ontology_update_cypher_statements`, and `forward_looking_context` including the new `UserMemoryProfile` & `KnowledgeGraphSchema`).
    *   **Internally Uses (Configured & Injected):**
        *   An instance of `LLMChatTool`.
        *   An instance of `CypherQueryExecutorTool` (The LLM outputs Cypher strings; this tool *executes* them. The composite tool orchestrates: LLM generates -> Executor runs).
    *   **Belongs in `ToolRegistry` as an atomic tool?** **No.** It is *built by* the `ToolRegistry`.

3.  **`HybridRetrievalTool` (HRT)**
    *   **Location:** `packages/tools/retrieval/HybridRetrievalTool.ts`
    *   **Purpose:** The sophisticated multi-stage retrieval system. It's complex enough that it *could* be considered a high-level composite tool itself, though it's more of a specialized utility.
    *   **Internally Uses (Deterministic Logic & Config):**
        *   Weaviate Client (direct or via a thin wrapper tool if needed for testing/abstraction).
        *   Neo4j Client (direct or via `CypherQueryExecutorTool`).
        *   PostgreSQL Repositories.
        *   Its internal micro-modules: `CypherBuilder`, `ParamGuard`, `EntityScorer`, `HydrationAdapter`.
        *   (Potentially an instance of `TextEmbeddingTool` for key phrases if not handled by Weaviate's `nearText`).
    *   **Belongs in `ToolRegistry` as an atomic tool?** This is a nuanced one.
        *   **Argument FOR:** It's a distinct, reusable retrieval capability. The `RealTimeOrchestrationTool` (for `DialogueAgent`) would be configured to use *an instance* of `HybridRetrievalTool`.
        *   **Argument AGAINST (Slightly stronger):** It's so specialized and core to the `DialogueAgent`'s retrieval loop that it might be directly instantiated and used by the `RealTimeOrchestrationTool` rather than being treated as a swappable atomic tool from the registry. However, making its dependencies (like specific Weaviate/Neo4j connection details or even the `CypherQueryExecutorTool`) configurable via the registry is still beneficial.
        *   **V9.1 Decision:** Let's treat `HybridRetrievalTool` as a **highly specialized component that can be directly instantiated by the composite tool that needs it (i.e., `RealTimeOrchestrationTool`)**, but its *own internal dependencies* (like the Neo4j driver or specific configuration for its `CypherBuilder`) could be sourced via the main application's dependency injection that initializes the `ToolRegistry` and other services. This keeps it out of the `tool_composition.json` as a swappable "atomic" part of a composite tool, acknowledging its unique, complex role.

---

**Summary of Tools Count & Registry Role:**

*   **Atomic Tools (Registered in `ToolRegistry`):**
    1.  `LLMChatTool` (with variants like `ai:llm:chat:google_gemini_1.5_pro`, `ai:llm:chat:google_gemini_1.5_flash`)
    2.  `VisionCaptionTool` (e.g., `data:vision:caption:google_vision`)
    3.  `AudioTranscribeTool` (e.g., `data:audio:transcribe:google_chirp`)
    4.  `DocumentExtractTool` (e.g., `data:document:extract:tika_service`)
    5.  `TextEmbeddingTool` (e.g., `ai:embedding:text:google_gecko`)
    6.  `CypherQueryExecutorTool` (e.g., `data:graph:cypher_executor:v1`)
    *   **Total: 6 core types of atomic tools**, each potentially having multiple named implementations in the registry (e.g., different LLM models or versions).

*   **Composite Tools (Built by `ToolRegistry` using `tool_composition.json`, NOT registered *as* atomic tools):**
    1.  `HolisticAnalysisTool` (for `IngestionAnalyst`)
    2.  `StrategicSynthesisTool` (for `InsightEngine`)
    *   **Total: 2 composite tools.**

*   **Specialized Orchestrator (Used by a Composite Tool, not directly built *from* `tool_composition.json` for its main functionality):**
    1.  `HybridRetrievalTool` (HRT)

So, the `ToolRegistry`'s primary job is to:
1.  Hold a catalog of all available **atomic tools**.
2.  Provide a `buildCompositeTool(agentName)` method that reads `config/tool_composition.json`, finds the configuration for the given agent, and constructs the specified composite tool by injecting the correct, named instances of atomic tools into it.

This makes the system extremely flexible. If we want the `IngestionAnalyst` to use a different LLM for its analysis, we just change the `atomicTools.llm` entry for `ingestionAnalyst` in `tool_composition.json`. No agent code changes. This is the power of the V9.1 architecture.


# Further clarifications

### **Definitive Canonical Guide: The V9.2 `ToolRegistry` & Configurable Composite Tools**

#### **1. The Core Principle: Configuration for Composite Tools, Direct Use for Agents**

The V9.2 architecture refines the use of tools:

*   **Specialized Agents (`IngestionAnalyst`, `InsightEngine`):** These agents perform complex, multi-step synthesis tasks that are well-defined for their operational domain (post-conversation analysis, cyclical strategic synthesis). For these agents, a **Composite Tool** (e.g., `HolisticAnalysisTool`) is constructed at initialization time by the `ToolRegistry` based on `config/tool_composition.json`. The agent then makes a "Single Synthesis Call" to this pre-configured composite tool. This allows for easy swapping of underlying atomic components (like LLM models) via configuration.

*   **Real-Time Agent (`DialogueAgent`):** This agent orchestrates a highly dynamic, conditional workflow for each conversational turn. It directly uses injected instances of **atomic tools** (e.g., `LLMChatTool`) and **specialized complex tools/services** (e.g., `HybridRetrievalTool`, `PromptBuilder`). It does *not* use a single "composite tool" for its entire turn logic, as its orchestration needs are too intricate and state-dependent for that abstraction.

This approach gives us:
*   **Efficiency:** Agents still make "Single Synthesis Calls" to their primary tool or LLM.
*   **Flexibility for Batch Agents:** We can easily change which sub-tools are used by the `IngestionAnalyst` or `InsightEngine` by editing `tool_composition.json` and restarting the service, without touching agent code.
*   **Clarity for Real-Time Agent:** The `DialogueAgent`'s complex orchestration logic remains within the agent itself, using directly injected, well-defined dependencies.

#### **2. The `ToolRegistry` V9.2: Factory for Composite Tools & Repository of Atomic Tools**

The `ToolRegistry` is a central service responsible for:
1.  **Cataloging Atomic Tools:** Discovering and registering all available "atomic" tools in the system.
2.  **Building Composite Tools:** Acting as a factory to construct `HolisticAnalysisTool` and `StrategicSynthesisTool` by injecting the correct, configured atomic tools into them, based on `config/tool_composition.json`.

*   **Location:** `packages/tool-registry/src/ToolRegistry.ts` (Package is re-instated and vital)
*   **Functionality:**
    1.  **On Startup:** The registry scans `packages/tools/ai/`, `packages/tools/data/`, etc., and registers every individual "atomic" tool it finds. Each atomic tool must expose a unique name (e.g., `ai:llm:chat:google_gemini_1.5_pro`, `data:vision:caption:default`).
    2.  **`getAtomicTool<T extends AtomicTool>(toolName: string): T`:** A method to retrieve a single, registered atomic tool instance, correctly typed.
    3.  **`buildCompositeToolForAgent(agentName: 'ingestionAnalyst' | 'insightEngine'): HolisticAnalysisTool | StrategicSynthesisTool`:** This is the powerful factory method. It reads `config/tool_composition.json`, finds the entry for `agentName`, retrieves the specified atomic tools using `getAtomicTool()`, and injects them into a new instance of the specified composite tool class (e.g., `HolisticAnalysisTool`).

#### **3. Atomic Tools vs. Composite Tools vs. Specialized Tools/Services**

*   **Atomic Tools (e.g., `LLMChatTool`, `VisionCaptionTool`):**
    *   Live in `packages/tools/ai/`, `packages/tools/data/`.
    *   Single, focused responsibility.
    *   Registered with the `ToolRegistry`.
    *   Injected into Composite Tools or directly into the `DialogueAgent`.

*   **Composite Tools (e.g., `HolisticAnalysisTool`, `StrategicSynthesisTool`):**
    *   Live in `packages/tools/composite/`.
    *   Orchestrate one or more atomic tools to perform a larger, agent-specific synthesis task.
    *   Are **built by** the `ToolRegistry` at agent initialization time, based on `config/tool_composition.json`.
    *   Provide a single `execute()` method for the agent to call.
    *   Are **NOT** themselves registered in the `ToolRegistry`'s list of atomic tools.

*   **Specialized Tools/Services (e.g., `HybridRetrievalTool`, `PromptBuilder`):**
    *   `HybridRetrievalTool` lives in `packages/tools/retrieval/`.
    *   `PromptBuilder` lives in `services/dialogue-service/src/`.
    *   These are complex components with specific roles, directly instantiated and used by the `DialogueAgent`. They are not "composite tools" in the sense of being dynamically assembled by the registry from `tool_composition.json` for the `DialogueAgent`. Their dependencies are managed through standard dependency injection when the `DialogueAgent` service is initialized.

#### **4. The Configuration File: `config/tool_composition.json` (V9.2 Scope)**

This file now *only* defines the composition for the tools used by the `IngestionAnalyst` and `InsightEngine`. The `DialogueAgent`'s tools (`LLMChatTool`, `HybridRetrievalTool`, etc.) are directly injected when the `dialogue-service` is initialized, though their specific *instances* (e.g., which LLM model) might still be determined by global app config.

*   **Location:** `config/tool_composition.json`
*   **Content (V9.2 Example):**
    ```json
    {
      "ingestionAnalyst": {
        "compositeToolClassName": "HolisticAnalysisTool", // Class name to instantiate
        "atomicTools": { // Name of property in composite tool : Name of atomic tool in registry
          "llmChatTool": "ai:llm:chat:google_gemini_1.5_pro",
          "textEmbeddingTool": "ai:embedding:text:google_gecko_v1"
          // ... other atomic tools needed by HolisticAnalysisTool
        }
      },
      "insightEngine": {
        "compositeToolClassName": "StrategicSynthesisTool",
        "atomicTools": {
          "synthesisLlmTool": "ai:llm:chat:deepseek_v2_pro_strategic", // Potentially a different LLM config
          "cypherQueryExecutorTool": "data:graph:cypher_executor:v1"
          // ... other atomic tools needed by StrategicSynthesisTool
        }
      }
      // NO entry for "dialogueAgent" here for a composite tool.
      // DialogueAgent is configured with its atomic tools directly.
    }
    ```

#### **5. Revised Initialization & Workflow**

**System Startup:**
1.  The main application initializes the `ToolRegistry`.
2.  The `ToolRegistry` scans `packages/tools/` and registers all available **atomic tools** (e.g., `LLMChatTool` instances for various models, `VisionCaptionTool`, etc.). It reads their metadata to know their unique names.

**Agent/Service Initialization:**

*   **`DialogueAgent` (in `services/dialogue-service/`):**
    *   When the `DialogueAgent` service starts, its constructor receives (via dependency injection):
        *   An instance of `PromptBuilder`.
        *   An instance of `HybridRetrievalTool`.
        *   A *specific instance* of an atomic `LLMChatTool` (e.g., one configured for fast responses, perhaps read from a global app config like `process.env.DIALOGUE_AGENT_LLM_MODEL_NAME` which the main app uses to fetch the correct tool from the registry and inject).
        *   Instances of atomic `VisionCaptionTool`, `AudioTranscribeTool`, etc.

*   **`IngestionAnalyst` (in `workers/ingestion-worker/`):**
    1.  When the `IngestionAnalyst` worker process starts, it instantiates the `ToolRegistry`.
    2.  It calls `toolRegistry.buildCompositeToolForAgent('ingestionAnalyst')`.
    3.  The `ToolRegistry` reads `config/tool_composition.json`, finds the `"ingestionAnalyst"` section.
    4.  It sees `"compositeToolClassName": "HolisticAnalysisTool"`.
    5.  It retrieves the specified atomic tools (e.g., an instance of `LLMChatTool` named `"ai:llm:chat:google_gemini_1.5_pro"`) from its internal catalog using `getAtomicTool()`.
    6.  It instantiates `HolisticAnalysisTool`, injecting these atomic tools.
    7.  The `IngestionAnalyst` worker now holds this fully configured `this.holisticAnalysisTool`.

*   **`InsightEngine` (in `workers/insight-worker/`):**
    *   Follows the same initialization pattern as `IngestionAnalyst`, calling `toolRegistry.buildCompositeToolForAgent('insightEngine')` to get its `StrategicSynthesisTool`.

**Agent Operation:**

*   **`DialogueAgent`:** Directly calls `this.promptBuilder.buildPrompt()`, then `this.llmChatTool.execute()`, then conditionally `this.hybridRetrievalTool.execute()`, then potentially `this.llmChatTool.execute()` again.
*   **`IngestionAnalyst`:** For each job, calls `this.holisticAnalysisTool.execute(transcript, profile, schema)`.
*   **`InsightEngine`:** For each job, calls `this.strategicSynthesisTool.execute(compiledCycleData, prevProfile, schema, etc.)`.

### **Conclusion: The V9.2 "Configurable Composite Tools for Batch Agents" Architecture**

This V9.2 approach provides a clear and effective model:

*   **`DialogueAgent`:** Maintains direct control over its intricate real-time orchestration, using directly injected, specifically configured atomic tools and specialized components (`PromptBuilder`, HRT).
*   **`IngestionAnalyst` & `InsightEngine`:** Benefit from the flexibility of having their primary synthesis logic encapsulated in Composite Tools (`HolisticAnalysisTool`, `StrategicSynthesisTool`). These composite tools are built by the `ToolRegistry` at initialization, injecting the appropriate atomic tools (like specific LLM models) as defined in `config/tool_composition.json`.
*   **`ToolRegistry`:** Its role is clearly defined as a catalog of atomic tools and a factory for the composite tools used by the batch-processing agents.

This architecture is robust, flexible where needed (for batch agents), and direct where speed and intricate control are paramount (for the real-time `DialogueAgent`). It correctly reflects the different operational needs of the agents.
