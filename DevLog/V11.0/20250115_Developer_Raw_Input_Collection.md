# Developer Raw Input Collection
**Date**: January 15, 2025

## **Initial Request: First-Time User Experience Assessment**

> "analyze the entire codebase and assess what the experience is like for a first time user, what will their dataset look like, what will each view look like, what are potential pain points given how the code logic is programed. For example, do we have a meaningful onboarding greeting that help user get started? will the dashboard be empty and show generic content? will the card column on the first dashboard tab have a no card found error message? will cosmos and card view be stuck in loading mode? Will the system even auto-populate user's first name in users table? Interrogate the codebase to like a tech lead to understand the actual state of UX initiation for a new user and think like a UX designer to identify opportunities to improve onboarding experience, starting with low hanging fruits. Create a markdown file in DevLog/V11.0 with today's date after your assessment and design thinking and planning."

## **Dot's Self-Awareness Vision**

> "if you look into how ingestion worker and insight worker works today, our system is focusing on user growth. As the developer, I care about the collective growth of the agent intelligence "Dot". I'm also tempted to create a knowledge graph for Dot so that it learns and tracks its own growth event and converse with me the developer. What do you think?"

> "don't trust the 9.5 which is very old spec. Treat current monorepo codebase as source of truth."

> "what would be Dot's source of insight? actual source code, development log, user interaction database, developer prompt, constitutional grounding prompt documents, developer's philosophy written into a book?"

## **Dot's Marketing & Self-Promotion**

> "I'm even thinking of letting Dot market itself to potential users. The landing page is basically Dot's own knowledge graph in an interactive cosmos quest view. Dot draws upon its own hybrid database and cached prompts and answers to interact with potential users to help them understand who it is, how it has evolved, what its philosophy is, etc. It can even articulate how it was built with vivid memory units and conversations between Dot and its developer."

> "I want to use this to demonstrate: 1. as a user, you can have this as your own growth platform and personal and authentic narrative outlet, which shares your value proposition clearly and interactively (with people who otherwise only get to know you through facebook, instagram, linkedin, personal website, college application paperwork); 2. through Dot's cosmos and my (developer) cosmos side-by-side on shared sky, it shows that parents and children can have this fostering and collective growth experience as a family. From developer perspective, starting very early on, I turn dot into a tool that helps me personally as a seed user, and building 2dost1line into next level."

## **Competitive Analysis Request**

> "conduct web research to understand who am I competing with. Will what big tech are doing make my vision obsolete?"

> "my teammates are working on cloudhosting as we speak."

> "I hope you are not saying this to make me happy."

> "why would big tech copy me?"

## **Integrated Onboarding & Marketing Strategy**

> "consider ideas from @Exploring growth strategies for Dot I want the onboaring and marketing to be integrated. There are two modes: mode 1: landing page is Dot's own cosmos and any visitor can query Dot's cosmos graph (we will implement app side KV caching so that most of the queries can be handled within app without making explicit LLM call to save on token), after a few turns, Dot will ask in the chat whether the visitor would like to introduce themselves and if yes will be taken to sign up and in the background the user data and initial state of all views will be prepared and user queries will be sent to LLM with rate limits and Dot is leading the conversation to gather anchoring user memory profile. In the background, ingestion and insight workers are run to populate full set of all pages, once that's ready, Dot invite user to explore their dashboard, cosmos, card gallery and chat, etc. In mode 2, it's similar experience as mode 1, except that the user gets to the landing page because of their friend sent them link inviting them to explore and / or contribute to their existing cosmos. Therefore, user instead of seeing Dot's cosmos, they see the cosmos of someone they know. User sign up and log in is immediately required before new user can access existing user (their friend or family)'s cosmos for obvious reasons. The dialogue/quest agent as user interacts with the cosmos asking questions and have conversation with Dot is strategically prompting the user / helping the user to explore in a way that helps Dot understand the new user (based on their relationship with existing user, the type of questions they ask, how they respond to Dot's follow up question, etc.) after a few turns, Dot prompts user "I took the liberty of creating a cosmos of your own, would you like to see it" then the same idea as mode 1. Please think through this and reflect in the md file"

## **Dual-Perspective Marketing Refinement**

> "In other words, as a developer and designer of this system, the initial round of marketing consists of 1. public facing mode 1. 2. my personal cosmos (curated sections that are accessible for marketing and onboarding purpose, now revealing everything about me). This is only a demo point for shared memories across people with meaningful relationships. The only special thing about Dot is that it's its own agent. It synthesizes its own memory and suggest own growth next steps etc. But other than that, as a 3rd person, they can ask questions like how I (developer) came up with the idea of building Dot and see both of us's perspective and narrative simultaneously"

## **AI Data Flywheel & Trust-Based Feedback**

> "Now let's talk about the data flywheel. When people talk about AI product evolvement, they think of A/B testing, asking AI to generate different versions of the responses and see which one user likes, have heart and vote buttons. I think this is pre-AI method. I want to let AI to realize when it's time to ask for direct and real-time behavioral feedback (search the web on McKinsey's feedback culture). For example, when the user came back for a long time, the AI shoudl know to subtly ask about how the user has been and what's new, etc. (not so much in an insecure way but genuinely find out what has changed in the user's environment, situation and attention focus. If the user seems annoyed in the conversation, the AI should know to take a step back and ask "I noticed that you may feel frustrated, may I ask what I could have done differently". Even if all things go well, the AI should be proactive soliciting feedback (I cannot stop by thinking back at how McKinsey has shaped me)- I have been thinking of growing in this and that direction, what do you think? would that be helpful to you if I can do this or that or change this way or that way. It's much like a human strategic advisor (say McKinsey senior partner) having a trust based relationship with the CXOs they advise."

## **Dot-Centric Learning Paradigm**

> "i noticed that your technical implementation is still very deterministic. How can we leverage the existence of "Dot" who has its own cosmos, knowledge graph, centralized intelligence? How can we do a new way of model training--not pairing raw questions with responses but let agent proactively learn directly from user and when that conversation gets ingested, anonymized data (memory unit, concepts, growth events) get sent to Dot's centralized database?"

## **Data Sovereignty & Privacy-Preserving Learning**

> "Now we are touching on another user pain point: data security and Privacy-preserving. The big tech like to have access to user's full data for analysis. I want user to have their data locally. I only care about Dot's learning moments and Dot would be very transparent about what it plans to share back with its own centralized knowledge base."

## **Gamified Feedback Ecosystem**

> "We incentivize user to engage in candid feedback sessions. Dot proactively let user know if their feedback has been implemented. There will be reward system designed around sharing their cosmos within their network and providing high quality growth oriented feedback."

## **Dot's Hybrid Database & Foundational Model Training**

> "let's continue. Please just log my raw input into raw input file and your thinking in to the larger document you created earlier. Please understand how our data pipeline works and how raw conversation data gets formed into a hybrid PG, weaviate and neo4j database. Now imagine what Dot's database would look like and how the pipeline would work since it's interfacing with countless users. In my mind (I'm not a AI and deep learning expert), LLM consists of tokens and inter-token links, which allows transformer to carve out an optimized path across the countless possible combination and sequencing of tokens as the answer. The hybrid data structure or the knowledge graph in particular consist of nodes and edges, which are more explicit version of a potential transformer skeleton. How do we directly use Dot's hybrid database to train foundational model?"

## **AI-Native Architecture: Beyond Pre-AI Determinism**

> **From Gemini Response Document**: "Beyond 'Pre-AI' Determinism: An AI-Native Architecture for Dot's Continuous Evolution" - The core insight is that traditional systems are built on explicit logic where developers anticipate user needs and hardcode behavior. Dot transcends this by becoming a self-evolving, centralized intelligence that learns from every interaction in real-time, not just responding to users but evolving with them.

## **Zero-Knowledge Prompt Synthesis (ZKPS) Architecture**

> **From Gemini Response Document**: The revolutionary approach where user data stays local, and only abstract problem representations are sent to external LLMs. The intelligence isn't in the data sent, but in the structure of the request created. This creates a system that achieves maximum intelligence with zero training costs, zero model lock-in, and zero privacy leakage.

## **The Wisdom Economy: Cosmos Sage Model**

> **From Gemini Response Document**: A unified "Wisdom Point" system that transforms the product from an application into a true, self-sustaining economy. Users earn points for personal growth and community contribution, spend points to access Sage wisdom, and Sages can cash out points for real money. This creates a meritocracy where genuine wisdom is recognized and rewarded.
