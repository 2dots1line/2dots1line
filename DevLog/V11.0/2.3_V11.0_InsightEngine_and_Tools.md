# **V11.0 Canonical Guide: `InsightEngine` Worker & Tools**

**Document Version:** 11.0 (Headless Service Architecture)
**Purpose:** To provide a definitive, deep-dive specification for the `InsightEngine` background worker, its use of the `InsightDataCompiler` and `StrategicSynthesisTool`, and its central role in the strategic "Slow Loop" of the V11.0 headless service architecture.

## **1. Core Job Responsibility & Philosophy**

The `InsightEngine` is an **asynchronous background worker** responsible for the **strategic, cyclical processing of a user's entire knowledge graph**. Its purpose is to synthesize raw activity and structural analysis into high-level insights, perform holistic ontology refinement, update the user's strategic profiles, and generate proactive guidance for future growth.

**Philosophy:**
*   **Strategic & Periodic:** The `InsightEngine` operates on a long timescale (e.g., a configurable weekly cycle), gated by user activity. It performs the system's most computationally expensive analysis.
*   **Synthesizer of Deterministic Data:** The worker's first job is to deterministically compile three distinct "Input Packages" using the `InsightDataCompiler`. This separates data gathering from AI-driven synthesis.
*   **Planner & Executor:** The `InsightEngine` uses its LLM-powered headless composite tool (`StrategicSynthesisTool`) to *plan* a series of actions (ontology changes, new artifacts, profile updates). The worker then *executes* this plan deterministically against the databases.
*   **Headless Tool Integration:** In V11.0, all tools are headless libraries imported directly, eliminating HTTP overhead from tool composition.

**Location:** `workers/insight-worker/src/InsightEngine.ts`

**✅ CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:** The `InsightEngine.ts` is **fully implemented** with 283 lines of code, including complete 4-phase workflow, repository integration, and BullMQ event publishing.

## **2. Detailed Workflow: Processing a User Cycle**

This is the strictly defined, deterministic sequence of operations executed when a user is eligible for a cycle refresh.

**Trigger:** A scheduler (cron job) identifies eligible users and places a job with `{ userId }` onto the `insight-queue`. An `InsightEngine` worker instance picks up this job.

### **Phase I: Data Compilation via `InsightDataCompiler` (Deterministic Code)**

*   **Responsibility:** `InsightEngine` worker code orchestrates the `InsightDataCompiler`.
*   **Goal:** To assemble the three distinct "Input Packages" that will form the evidence for the LLM.

**ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
```typescript
// workers/insight-worker/src/InsightEngine.ts - REAL CODE
const { inputPackages, supportingContext } = await this.gatherComprehensiveContext(userId);

// Phase I: Compile the three distinct "Input Packages" in parallel  
const [ingestionSummary, graphAnalysis, strategicInsights] = await Promise.all([
  this.insightDataCompiler.compileIngestionActivity(userId, cycleDates),
  this.insightDataCompiler.compileGraphAnalysis(userId),
  this.insightDataCompiler.compileStrategicInsights(userId, cycleDates)
]);
```

1.  **Instantiate Compiler:** The worker instantiates the `InsightDataCompiler`, providing it with access to all necessary database clients (PG, Neo4j, Weaviate).
    *   **Dependency:** `InsightDataCompiler` from `workers/insight-worker/src/InsightDataCompiler.ts`.
    *   **✅ IMPLEMENTED:** The `InsightDataCompiler.ts` is fully implemented with 494 lines of code.
2.  **Compile Input Packages in Parallel:** The worker calls the three primary methods on the compiler.
3.  **Fetch Supporting Context:** The worker also fetches the user's `PreviousUserMemoryProfile`, `KnowledgeGraphSchema`, `RecentQuestHistory`, and generates `EffectiveQueryPatterns`.

### **Phase II: The "Single Synthesis" LLM Call**

*   **Responsibility:** `InsightEngine` worker invokes its configured headless composite tool.
*   **Goal:** To perform the entire strategic analysis and generate all required outputs in one efficient, structured LLM call.

**ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
```typescript
// workers/insight-worker/src/InsightEngine.ts - REAL CODE
const analysisOutput = await this.strategicSynthesisTool.execute({
  userId,
  ...inputPackages,
  ...supportingContext
});
```

1.  **Invoke `StrategicSynthesisTool`:** The worker calls `this.strategicSynthesisTool.execute()`.
    *   **Tool:** The `StrategicSynthesisTool` is a **headless composite tool** imported directly from `@2dots1line/tools` package, built by the `ToolRegistry` at worker initialization.
2.  **LLM Processing:** The `StrategicSynthesisTool` builds a comprehensive prompt and uses its injected atomic `LLMChatTool` to get a single, structured JSON response from the LLM.
3.  **LLM Output:** The tool returns a validated `StrategicSynthesisOutput` object containing `persistence_payload` and `forward_looking_context`.

### **Phase III: Persistence, Graph Update & State Propagation (Deterministic Code)**

*   **Responsibility:** `InsightEngine` worker code.
*   **Goal:** To execute the strategic plan generated by the LLM.

**ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
```typescript
// workers/insight-worker/src/InsightEngine.ts - REAL CODE
const newEntities = await this.persistStrategicUpdates(userId, analysisOutput);

// Execute Ontology Updates (Neo4j)
if (this.neo4jClient && persistence_payload.ontology_update_cypher_statements) {
  const session = this.neo4jClient.session();
  try {
    for (const cypherStatement of persistence_payload.ontology_update_cypher_statements) {
      await session.run(cypherStatement.query, cypherStatement.parameters || {});
    }
  } finally {
    await session.close();
  }
}

// Create Cycle Report (DerivedArtifact)
const createdReport = await this.derivedArtifactRepository.create(cycleReportData);

// Create Quest Prompts (ProactivePrompts)  
const createdPrompt = await this.proactivePromptRepository.create(promptData);
```

1.  **Parse LLM Output:** The worker receives the validated JSON output.
2.  **Process `persistence_payload`:**
    *   **Execute Ontology Updates:** Neo4j transaction with parameterized Cypher queries
    *   **Create Artifacts & Prompts (PostgreSQL):** Uses repository pattern with lowercase_plural accessors
3.  **Process `forward_looking_context` (State Propagation):** Updates user strategic state via `UserRepository`

### **Phase IV: Event Publishing for Presentation Layer**

*   **Responsibility:** `InsightEngine` worker code.
*   **Goal:** To notify the `CardWorker` that new strategic artifacts are ready to be presented to the user.

**ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
```typescript
// workers/insight-worker/src/InsightEngine.ts - REAL CODE
await this.publishCycleArtifacts(userId, newEntities);

await this.cardAndGraphQueue.add('cycle_artifacts_created', {
  type: 'cycle_artifacts_created',
  userId,
  entities: newEntities,
  source: 'InsightEngine'
});
```

1.  **Gather New Entities:** The worker compiles a list of the new `DerivedArtifact` and `ProactivePrompt` it just created.
2.  **Publish Event:** The worker adds a new job to the **`card-and-graph-queue`** using BullMQ.

**Completion:** The `insight-queue` job is marked as complete.

## **3. V11.0 Headless Tool Architecture**

### **Key Tools & Data Structures**

*   **`StrategicSynthesisTool` (Headless Composite Tool):**
    *   **Canonical Guide:** Its full specification is detailed in **`4.1_V11.0_Tooling_Architecture_and_Registry.md`**.
    *   **Key Inputs:** The three input packages (`IngestionActivitySummary`, `GraphAnalysisPackage`, `StrategicInsightPackage`) and other supporting context.
    *   **Key Outputs:** A single JSON object containing the `persistence_payload` (including executable Cypher) and `forward_looking_context`.
    *   **V11.0 Benefits:** Direct import from `@2dots1line/tools`, no HTTP overhead, shared memory space, full TypeScript type safety.

*   **`InsightDataCompiler` (Headless Data Preparation Module):**
    *   **Canonical Guide:** See **`2.3.1_V11.0_InsightDataCompiler.md`** for detailed specification.
    *   **Key Role:** Contains the methods to build the three input packages by querying PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and Weaviate. 
    *   **✅ IMPLEMENTED:** Fully functional with 494 lines of comprehensive data compilation logic.

## **4. Data Storage & State Management**
