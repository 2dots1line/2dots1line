# **V11.0 Canonical Guide: `IngestionAnalyst` Worker & Tools**

**Document Version:** 11.0 (Headless Service Architecture)
**Purpose:** To provide a definitive, deep-dive specification for the `IngestionAnalyst` background worker, its composite `HolisticAnalysisTool`, and its role in the "Fast Loop" of the V11.0 headless service architecture.

## **1. Core Job Responsibility & Philosophy**

The `IngestionAnalyst` is an **asynchronous background worker** responsible for the **holistic synthesis of a completed conversation**. Its core job is to transform the raw, unstructured transcript of a dialogue into structured, interconnected knowledge within the user's graph. It then publishes an event containing these new knowledge entities for downstream workers (`CardWorker`, `GraphProjectionWorker`) to process.

**Philosophy:**
*   **Reactive & Asynchronous:** The `IngestionAnalyst` never blocks the user. It operates "after the fact," ensuring that the real-time conversation remains fast and fluid.
*   **Holistic Context:** It analyzes the *entire* conversation at once, allowing it to understand nuances, context, and make connections that a turn-by-turn analysis would miss.
*   **Knowledge Generator, Not Presenter:** Its sole responsibility is to generate and persist knowledge (`MemoryUnit`s, `Concept`s, etc.). It is explicitly **not** responsible for creating user-facing `Card`s. It simply provides the "card-worthy" ingredients for another worker to use.
*   **Headless Tool Integration:** In V11.0, the `HolisticAnalysisTool` is a headless library imported directly, eliminating HTTP overhead from tool composition.

**Location:** `workers/ingestion-worker/src/IngestionAnalyst.ts`

**✅ IMPLEMENTATION ALIGNMENT:** The current `IngestionAnalyst.ts` implementation is **well-aligned** with this specification and follows the expected V11.0 patterns for worker architecture.

## **2. Detailed Workflow: Processing an Ingestion Job**

This is the strictly defined, deterministic sequence of operations executed for every job from the `ingestion-queue`.

**Trigger:** The `conversation-timeout-worker` queues a job with `{ conversationId, userId }`. An `IngestionAnalyst` worker instance picks this job up from the BullMQ `ingestion-queue`.

### **Phase I: Data Gathering & Preparation (Deterministic Code)**

1.  **Fetch Full Transcript:** The worker uses `ConversationRepository` to fetch all `ConversationMessage` records for the `conversationId`. It assembles them into a single, formatted transcript string (`fullConversationTranscript`).
2.  **Fetch Core Context:** The worker uses `UserRepository` to fetch the user's current:
    *   `UserMemoryProfile`
    *   `KnowledgeGraphSchema`
    These provide the essential context of the user's existing knowledge world for the LLM.

### **Phase II: The "Single Synthesis" LLM Call**

*   **Responsibility:** `IngestionAnalyst` invokes its configured composite tool.
*   **Goal:** To perform the entire analysis and generate all required outputs in one efficient, structured LLM call.

1.  **Invoke `HolisticAnalysisTool`:** The worker calls `this.holisticAnalysisTool.execute()`.
    *   **Tool:** The `HolisticAnalysisTool` is a **headless composite tool** imported directly from `@2dots1line/tools` package, built by the `ToolRegistry` at worker initialization. No HTTP overhead is involved.
    *   **Input to Tool:** `{ fullConversationTranscript, userMemoryProfile, knowledgeGraphSchema }`.
2.  **LLM Processing:** The `HolisticAnalysisTool` builds a comprehensive prompt and uses its injected atomic `LLMChatTool` to get a single, structured JSON response from the LLM.
3.  **LLM Output:** The tool returns a validated `HolisticAnalysisOutput` object containing two main parts: `persistence_payload` and `forward_looking_context`.

### **Phase II.5: Semantic Deduplication (New V11.0 Feature)**

*   **Responsibility:** `IngestionAnalyst` worker code with `SemanticSimilarityTool`.
*   **Goal:** To identify and reuse existing entities instead of creating duplicates, improving knowledge graph quality and reducing redundancy.

1.  **Extract Candidate Entities:** The worker extracts all candidate `Concept` and `MemoryUnit` entities from the LLM output's `persistence_payload`.
2.  **Semantic Similarity Check:** For each candidate entity, the worker uses the `SemanticSimilarityTool` to find the most similar existing entity:
    *   **Tool Input:** `{ candidateNames: [entity names], userId, entityTypes: ['concept', 'memory_unit'] }`
    *   **Tool Output:** Array of similarity results with best matches and similarity scores
3.  **Deduplication Decision:** For each candidate entity:
    *   **If similarity score > threshold (0.8):** Reuse existing entity, update with new insights
    *   **If similarity score ≤ threshold:** Create new entity
    *   **Entity Type Mismatch:** Always create new (e.g., don't reuse a concept as a memory unit)
4.  **Entity Mapping:** The worker creates a mapping from candidate entity names to actual entity IDs (either existing or new) for relationship resolution.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Prevents Duplicate Entities:** Avoids creating multiple similar concepts or memory units
- **Incremental Knowledge Building:** Updates existing entities with new insights from current conversation
- **Relationship Integrity:** Ensures relationships point to the correct (reused or new) entities
- **Semantic Accuracy:** Uses vector similarity for intelligent entity matching

### **Phase III: Persistence & Graph Update (Deterministic Code)**

*   **Responsibility:** `IngestionAnalyst` worker code.
*   **Goal:** To save the structured knowledge generated by the LLM into PostgreSQL and Neo4j databases only. Weaviate indexing is handled by a separate `embedding-worker`.

1.  **Receive & Validate JSON:** The `IngestionAnalyst` worker receives the single structured JSON from its composite tool. It validates this output against a strict Zod schema. This validation **MUST** include an `enum` check for the `dim_key` in `detected_growth_events` to ensure it is one of the six valid keys.
2.  **Check Importance Score:** The worker first checks the `persistence_payload.conversation_importance_score`. If it's below a configured threshold (currently set to 1 for testing), it may update the `Conversation` summary and status but **skip the creation of new knowledge entities**.
3.  **Execute Persistence Transactions:** Assuming the score is high enough:
    *   **PostgreSQL:**
        *   Updates the `Conversation` record with the `summary` and `importance_score`, and sets `status` to `'processed'`.
        *   **Entity Creation/Update:** Based on deduplication decisions:
            *   **New Entities:** Creates new `MemoryUnit` and `Concept` records with resolved UUIDs
            *   **Reused Entities:** Updates existing entities with new descriptions (appending format: "existing: new")
        *   Creates new `GrowthEvent` records, storing the `rationale` in the `details` JSONB field.
        *   Increments the `User.concepts_created_in_cycle` counter.
    *   **Neo4j:**
        *   **New Entities:** Creates new `:MemoryUnit` and `:Concept` nodes
        *   **Reused Entities:** Updates existing nodes with new properties
        *   **Relationships:** Creates relationships using the entity mapping from deduplication (ensuring relationships point to correct entity IDs)

4.  **Persist Forward-Looking Context:** The worker saves the `forward_looking_context` object from the LLM output to the `User.next_conversation_context_package` field in PostgreSQL.

### **Phase IV: Event Publishing**

*   **Responsibility:** `IngestionAnalyst` worker code.
*   **Goal:** To notify downstream workers that new knowledge is ready for embedding and presentation.

1.  **Gather New Entities:** The worker compiles a list of all the new, persistent `MemoryUnit` and `Concept` entities it just created.
2.  **Publish Embedding Jobs:** For each new entity, the worker adds a job to the **`embedding-queue`**.
    *   **Queue:** `embedding-queue` (BullMQ).
    *   **Job Payload:**
        ```json
        {
          "entityId": "muid-123",
          "entityType": "MemoryUnit",
          "textContent": "The full text content to be embedded...",
          "userId": "user-456"
        }
        ```
3.  **Publish Presentation Event:** The worker adds a new job to the **`card-and-graph-queue`**.
    *   **Queue:** `card-and-graph-queue` (BullMQ).
    *   **Job Payload:**
        ```json
        {
          "type": "new_entities_created",
          "userId": "...",
          "entities": [
            { "id": "muid-123", "type": "MemoryUnit" },
            { "id": "concept-abc", "type": "Concept" }
          ],
          "source": "IngestionAnalyst"
        }
        ```

**Completion:** The `ingestion-queue` job is marked as complete.

## **3. V11.0 Headless Tool Architecture**

### **Tool Dependencies**

The `IngestionAnalyst` uses two headless tools in V11.0:

#### **`HolisticAnalysisTool` Integration**

*   **Direct Import:** `import { HolisticAnalysisTool } from '@2dots1line/tools'`
*   **No HTTP Overhead:** Direct method calls instead of API requests
*   **Shared Memory Space:** Efficient object sharing within the worker process
*   **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript type checking across the tool interface
*   **Canonical Guide:** Its full specification is detailed in **`4.1_V11.0_Tooling_Architecture_and_Registry.md`**.
*   **Key Inputs:** `fullConversationTranscript`, `userMemoryProfile`, `knowledgeGraphSchema`.
*   **Key Outputs:** A single JSON object containing `persistence_payload` (for saving knowledge) and `forward_looking_context` (for the next conversation).

#### **`SemanticSimilarityTool` Integration (New V11.0 Feature)**

*   **Direct Import:** `import { SemanticSimilarityTool } from '@2dots1line/tools'`
*   **Purpose:** Dedicated semantic similarity checking for entity deduplication

## **6. V11.0 Performance Benefits**

The headless architecture provides significant performance improvements:

*   **50-80% Reduced Latency:** Direct method calls eliminate HTTP overhead
*   **Simplified Error Handling:** No network-level failures between components
*   **Enhanced Memory Efficiency:** Shared objects within worker process
*   **Improved Debugging:** Direct stack traces across tool boundaries

This detailed guide for the V11.0 `IngestionAnalyst` worker defines its crucial role in the "Fast Loop," clarifying its workflow, its reliance on a headless composite tool, and its responsibility to publish events for the presentation layer, creating a clean separation of concerns within the headless service architecture.
