Of course. Recovering from a project corruption is stressful, but a systematic approach will get your development environment back to a stable, productive state. Based on the excellent and detailed documentation you've provided, I have a clear picture of what's needed.

Let's walk through this step-by-step.

First, to answer your direct questions:

1.  **Should you reset Docker?**
    **Yes, absolutely.** Given the situation, starting with fresh database containers and volumes is the safest way to guarantee there are no lingering data inconsistencies. We will completely remove the old containers and their data.

2.  **Should you cleanse `node_modules`, caches, and build artifacts?**
    **Yes.** Your own `20250605BUILD_DEBUGGING_REPORT.md` (Chapter 11) provides the definitive procedure for this. It's a critical step to prevent strange, hard-to-debug issues from stale caches or dependencies.

Here is your comprehensive guide to restoring the development environment.

---

### **Step-by-Step Environment Restoration Guide**

This guide will walk you through a complete cleanup and re-setup of your project.

#### **Phase 1: Total Workspace Cleanup**

This phase ensures that no old files, caches, or containers can interfere with the setup.

**1. Clean Codebase Artifacts**

First, we'll run the thorough cleaning process outlined in your build report. Execute these commands from the root of your project directory (`/Users/danniwang/Documents/GitHub/202506062D1L/2D1L`):

```bash
# Remove all root and nested node_modules, dist, .next, .turbo, and .tsbuildinfo files
find . -name "node_modules" -type d -prune -exec rm -rf '{}' +
find . -name "dist" -type d -prune -exec rm -rf '{}' +
find . -name ".next" -type d -prune -exec rm -rf '{}' +
find . -name ".turbo" -type d -prune -exec rm -rf '{}' +
find . -name "*.tsbuildinfo" -type f -delete

# Remove the root pnpm-lock.yaml to ensure a fresh install
rm -f pnpm-lock.yaml

# Prune the pnpm store to remove orphaned packages
pnpm store prune
```

**2. Reset Docker Environment**

Now, let's completely reset the Docker services.

```bash
# Make sure Docker Desktop is running
open -a Docker

# Wait for it to start, then run this from your project root
# This stops containers, removes them, AND removes their associated data volumes.
docker-compose down -v

# As an extra precaution, manually remove the host-bound data directories
# This ensures no old data remains.
sudo rm -rf ./postgres_data ./neo4j_data ./weaviate_data ./redis_data

# The '2d1l_network' is external. If it was somehow removed, this command will recreate it.
# It's safe to run; it will do nothing if the network already exists.
docker network create 2d1l_network || true
```

At this point, your project directory is clean of all generated artifacts, and your Docker environment is empty.

---

#### **Phase 2: Rebuilding the Foundation**

Now we will build everything back up from your clean source code.

**3. Start Fresh Database Services**

```bash
# Start all database containers defined in docker-compose.yml in detached mode
docker-compose up -d
```

Give the containers a minute to initialize. You can check their status with `docker ps`. All four databases (postgres, neo4j, weaviate, redis) should show as `Up` and `healthy`.

**4. Install Project Dependencies**

With a clean slate, install all dependencies using `pnpm`.

```bash
# This will read all package.json files and create a fresh pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```

This should complete without errors.

**5. Set Up Database Schemas and Clients**

This step applies the schemas for each database, as detailed in your reset documents.

**A. PostgreSQL (Prisma)**

 **Run Prisma Validate from the monorepo root:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma validate --schema=./packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma
    ```
    This should now pass without errors.
**If validation passes, generate and apply the new initial migration:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init_v7_schema_corrected --schema=./packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma
    ```
    This command should now successfully create a new migration based on this corrected schema and apply it to your fresh database.
**Generate Prisma Client:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate --schema=./packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma
    ```
**Test with Prisma Studio:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma studio --schema=./packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma
    ```
    It should open and display all your V7 tables correctly.
```

**B. Neo4j (Cypher Shell)**

This uses the robust command from your `Neo4jReset.md` to correctly handle environment variables and apply the `schema.cypher`.

```bash
# Read credentials from your .env file
NEO4J_USER_ENV=$(grep NEO4J_USER .env | cut -d '=' -f2)
NEO4J_PASSWORD_ENV=$(grep NEO4J_PASSWORD .env | cut -d '=' -f2)

echo "Attempting to apply Neo4j schema as user: $NEO4J_USER_ENV"

# Execute cypher-shell inside the container, feeding it the schema file
docker exec -i neo4j-2d1l cypher-shell -u "$NEO4J_USER_ENV" -p "$NEO4J_PASSWORD_ENV" < ./packages/database/scripts/schema.cypher
```
You should see output indicating constraints and indexes were added. You can verify in the Neo4j Browser (`http://localhost:7475`) with `SHOW CONSTRAINTS;`and `SHOW INDEXES;` to confirm they were created.

**C. Weaviate (Script)**

This runs the TypeScript script you created to apply the Weaviate schema.

```bash
# Run the schema application script via turbo
pnpm --filter=@2dots1line/database db:weaviate:schema
```

This will connect to Weaviate and create the classes defined in `schema.json`.

---

#### **Phase 3: Building and Verifying the Application**

Your databases are now set up. The final step is to build the application code and verify that everything works.

**6. Perform a Full Monorepo Build**

Use the `--force` flag to ensure Turborepo builds everything from scratch, ignoring any potential stale cache.

```bash
# This is the command to build all packages, services, and apps
pnpm build --force
```

This command should complete successfully for all packages, with no build errors.

**7. Verify the System**

Your environment is now fully restored. The final step is to run the services and perform a quick end-to-end test, as outlined in your `USER_MANUAL.md`.

**A. Start the Backend Service:**

Your `20250606AgentAPIIntegration.md` plan indicates the `api-gateway` should run on port 3001. Let's start it there.

```bash
# In a new terminal
cd apps/api-gateway
pnpm dev
```
*(Note: Your `USER_MANUAL.md` has conflicting information about port 8000 vs 3001. Based on your integration plan, 3001 seems to be the correct path forward. The `pnpm dev` script in `api-gateway` likely defaults to port 3001).*

**B. Start the Frontend Service:**

```bash
# In another new terminal
cd apps/web-app
pnpm dev
```

**C. Test an API Endpoint:**

Use `curl` to test the registration endpoint. **Note:** I have updated the port to `3001` to match how we started the service.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test-restore@example.com","password":"TestPass123","name":"Restore User"}'
```

You should receive a JSON response, likely containing a JWT token. This confirms the API Gateway can connect to the fresh PostgreSQL database.

You are now ready to resume your work as planned in `20250606AgentAPIIntegration.md`. Your development environment is in a clean, stable, and known-good state.



### 1. The API Gateway in Docker: Hybrid Development Explained

This is the most critical point of confusion, and your `USER_MANUAL.md` touches upon it. You are using a **hybrid development model**.

*   **What you see in `docker-compose.yml`:** The `docker-compose.yml` file defines your *entire application stack* as if it were to run in a fully containerized environment (like a production server). It correctly includes the `api-gateway` service, its build instructions (`dockerfile`), and its dependencies on the databases.

*   **Why `api-gateway` might start with `docker-compose up -d`:** Yes, if you just run `docker-compose up -d`, Docker will try to build and start the `api-gateway` container alongside the databases.

*   **Why we run it locally with `pnpm dev` for development:** Running the application code (like your API Gateway) *directly on your local machine* is vastly more efficient for development.
    *   **Hot-Reloading:** When you change a source file in `apps/api-gateway/src`, `pnpm dev` (which uses a tool like `ts-node-dev` or `nodemon`) instantly restarts the server. If it were in Docker, you'd have to rebuild the entire Docker image for every single change, which is incredibly slow.
    *   **Debugging:** You can easily see `console.log` output in your terminal and connect your IDE's debugger to the local Node.js process. Debugging inside a Docker container is much more complex.
    *   **Simplicity:** You just work with the files directly.

So, the rationale is:
> **We use Docker for the stateful, slow-to-change services (databases), but run the stateless, rapidly-changing application code locally for speed and flexibility.**

The `api-gateway` definition in `docker-compose.yml` is essentially for future use (e.g., production deployment or CI/CD testing) or for a developer who *chooses* a fully containerized workflow. For your day-to-day work described in `20250606AgentAPIIntegration.md`, you will run it locally.

**To avoid this confusion and prevent it from starting in Docker**, a common practice is to comment out the application services in your `docker-compose.yml` during local development.

```yaml:docker-compose.yml
//... existing services like postgres, neo4j etc. ...

  # api-gateway: # COMMENTED OUT FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
  #   build:
  #     context: .
  #     dockerfile: ./apps/api-gateway/Dockerfile
  #   container_name: api-gateway-2d1l
  #   ports:
  #     - "${API_GATEWAY_HOST_PORT:-3001}:${API_GATEWAY_CONTAINER_PORT:-3001}"
  #   depends_on:
  #     postgres:
  #       condition: service_healthy
  #     neo4j:
  #       condition: service_healthy
  #     weaviate:
  #       condition: service_healthy
  #     redis:
  #       condition: service_healthy
  #   networks:
  #     - 2d1l_network
  #   environment:
  #     - PORT=${API_GATEWAY_CONTAINER_PORT:-3001}
  #     # ... and so on
  #   restart: unless-stopped
```
By commenting this out, `docker-compose up -d` will *only* start your databases, which is exactly what you want for the hybrid development model.

---

### 2. Database Folders and Schema Application Timing

Your second question is about the two-stage database setup.

*   **When do the `..._data` folders get created?**
    The folders (`postgres_data`, `neo4j_data`, etc.) are created on your local machine the moment you run `docker-compose up`. When Docker sees a volume mapping like `volumes: - ./postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`, it checks if `./postgres_data` exists on your machine. If not, Docker creates it before starting the container. This folder is then "mounted" into the container, linking the data directory inside the container to this folder on your host machine. This is what makes your data persist even if the container is removed.

*   **Why `docker-compose up` first, then apply schemas?**
    This is because we are separating two distinct jobs:
    1.  **Provisioning the Infrastructure (`docker-compose up`):** This command's only job is to start the *database server software*. It spins up a PostgreSQL server, a Neo4j server, etc. At this point, these servers are running, but they are "empty." They have no knowledge of your application's `User` tables or `Concept` nodes. They are just blank database servers waiting for instructions.
    2.  **Configuring the Application State (Schema Application):** Commands like `prisma migrate dev` and `cypher-shell` are *client tools*. They need to connect to an *already running* database server. Their job is to send commands (like `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE CONSTRAINT`) to that server to build the specific structures your application code needs to function.

You cannot apply the schema before the database server is running, just as you cannot put furniture in a house before the house has been built.

---

### 3. The Rationale for the Overall Sequence

The entire restoration process is designed as a layered, "ground-up" build to ensure stability and eliminate variables.

**Phase 1: Total Workspace Cleanup (Starting from Zero)**
*   **Why?** To create a *pristine and reproducible environment*. The biggest source of bugs in complex projects is stale state: old build artifacts in `dist`, cached dependencies in `node_modules`, corrupted data in database volumes, or cached build steps in `.turbo`. By aggressively deleting *all* of it, we guarantee that the subsequent steps are running on a clean slate. This eliminates an entire class of "it worked yesterday" problems.

**Phase 2: Rebuilding the Foundation (Infrastructure & Dependencies)**
This phase builds the non-code foundation that your application relies on.
*   **Step 3: Start Databases:** This is the lowest level of the foundation. We start the external services first because everything else will need to connect to them.
*   **Step 4: `pnpm install`:** This lays the next layer: the project's third-party and internal code dependencies. It builds the `node_modules` directory, making libraries and your own workspace packages (`@2dots1line/database`, etc.) available for the build process.
*   **Step 5: Schema Setup:** This is the crucial step that bridges the infrastructure (databases) and the code dependencies. We configure the running databases to match the expectations of your application code (e.g., creating the `users` table that the `@2dots1line/database` package provides methods for).

**Phase 3: Building and Verifying the Application (The Top Layer)**
Only when the foundation is perfectly in place can we build the final layer.
*   **Step 6: `pnpm build`:** This step compiles your TypeScript source code (`*.ts`) into executable JavaScript (`*.js`) in the `dist` folders. This process relies on everything from the previous phases: it needs `tsc` (from `node_modules`), it needs to import types from your packages (like `@2dots1line/shared-types`), and some packages might even need to connect to the database during their build step.
*   **Step 7: Verification:** This is the final "smoke test." We run the compiled code and test one simple, end-to-end user flow. This confirms that all the layers—from the Docker networking, to the database schemas, to the compiled code, to the runtime environment—are correctly integrated and working together.

This layered approach ensures that if a problem occurs, you know exactly at which stage it failed, making troubleshooting much easier. You're not debugging a database, a build tool, and your application logic all at once; you're building and verifying one stable layer at a time.



No, you shouldn't add that exact configuration to **all** subdirectories. Let me explain the proper ESLint configuration strategy for your monorepo:

Ran tool

Ran tool

Ran tool

Read file: .eslintrc.js
Now I understand! The root `.eslintrc.js` contains import ordering rules that are causing the import reordering. Here's the proper ESLint configuration strategy for your monorepo:

## ESLint Configuration Strategy

**You should NOT add the same config to all subdirectories.** Here's the right approach:

### 1. **Next.js Apps** (like `apps/web-app`)
```json
{
  "extends": ["../../.eslintrc.js", "next/core-web-vitals"]
}
```
✅ **Already correct** - Next.js apps need both the root config AND Next.js-specific rules.

### 2. **Pure TypeScript Packages** (like packages/*)
Most packages should **NOT** have their own `.eslintrc.json` and will inherit from the root automatically. However, if you want to be explicit, you can add:

```json
{
  "extends": ["../../.eslintrc.js"]
}
```

### 3. **Node.js Services** (like `services/cognitive-hub`)
```json
{
  "extends": ["../../.eslintrc.js"],
  "env": {
    "node": true,
    "browser": false
  }
}
```

### 4. **Storybook App**
```json
{
  "extends": ["../../.eslintrc.js"],
  "env": {
    "browser": true
  }
}
```

## Current Status

Your current setup is actually **correct**:
- ✅ Root `.eslintrc.js` provides shared rules for the entire monorepo
- ✅ `apps/web-app/.eslintrc.json` correctly extends root + Next.js rules
- ✅ Other packages inherit from root automatically

## Why the Import Reordering Happened

The import reordering you're seeing is **expected behavior** because your root ESLint config has this rule:

```javascript
'import/order': [
  'error',
  {
    'groups': ['builtin', 'external', 'internal', 'parent', 'sibling', 'index'],
    'newlines-between': 'always',
    'alphabetize': { 'order': 'asc', 'caseInsensitive': true }
  }
]
```

This enforces:
1. **Import grouping**: Node builtins → external packages → internal packages → relative imports
2. **Alphabetical ordering** within each group
3. **Newlines between groups**

This is actually **good** - it keeps your imports consistent across the entire codebase.

## Recommendation

**Keep your current configuration as-is.** Only add package-specific `.eslintrc.json` files if a package needs special rules (like different environments or additional plugins). For most TypeScript packages, inheriting from the root is sufficient and preferred.

## AI diagnostic commands

# Check what's actually in the database
cd /Users/danniwang/Documents/GitHub/202506062D1L/2D1L

# Check conversations (this should have data)
npx prisma studio
# Or via SQL:
psql -h localhost -U your_username -d your_database -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conversations;"

# Check sessions (this will be empty - that's normal)
psql -h localhost -U your_username -d your_database -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions;"


Excellent! 🎉 Let me help you with those three questions:

## **1. Safe to Remove cognitive-hub/src/tools Subdirectories**

**YES, it's safe to remove the tool subdirectories, but let me guide you through what to check first:**

**Check what's currently there:**
```bash
ls -la /Users/danniwang/Documents/GitHub/202506062D1L/2D1L/services/cognitive-hub/src/tools/
```

**What you should see and can safely remove:**
- `llm-tools/` directory (moved to `packages/ai-clients`)
- `document-tools/` directory (moved to `packages/document-tool`) 
- `text-tools/` directory (moved to `packages/text-tool`)
- `vision-tools/` directory (moved to `packages/vision-tool`)

**What you should KEEP:**
- `index.ts` file (this imports from packages and registers tools)

**Safe removal commands:**
```bash
cd /Users/danniwang/Documents/GitHub/202506062D1L/2D1L/services/cognitive-hub/src/tools/
rm -rf llm-tools/
rm -rf document-tools/
rm -rf text-tools/
rm -rf vision-tools/
# Keep index.ts!
```

## **2. Updating the System Prompt**

**File location:** `/Users/danniwang/Documents/GitHub/202506062D1L/2D1L/services/cognitive-hub/config/dot_system_prompt.json`

**To reflect changes after editing:**
```bash
# You need to restart the API Gateway
cd /Users/danniwang/Documents/GitHub/202506062D1L/2D1L
pkill -f "api-gateway"
sleep 3
cd apps/api-gateway && pnpm dev
```

**Why:** The DialogueAgent loads the system prompt once during initialization in its constructor. It doesn't watch for file changes, so you need to restart the service.

**Pro tip:** You can also just edit the JSON file and test immediately - the changes will take effect on the next API Gateway restart.

## **3. Viewing Data in Weaviate and Neo4j**

### **Weaviate Data Exploration:**

**Option A: Weaviate Console (Web UI)**
```bash
# Weaviate should be running on port 8080
open http://localhost:8080/v1/meta
```

**Option B: Query via API**
```bash
# See all classes
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/schema

# Query UserMemory objects
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/objects?class=UserMemory&limit=10"

# Query ConversationChunk objects  
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/objects?class=ConversationChunk&limit=10"
```

**Option C: Weaviate Client Console (if installed)**
```bash
pip install weaviate-client
python3 -c "
import weaviate
client = weaviate.Client('http://localhost:8080')
print('Schema:', client.schema.get())
print('UserMemory count:', client.query.aggregate('UserMemory').with_meta_count().do())
"
```

### **Neo4j Data Exploration:**

**Option A: Neo4j Browser (Web UI)**
```bash
# Open Neo4j Browser
open http://localhost:7474/browser/
# Login: neo4j / password (check your .env file)
```

**Option B: Cypher Queries via Browser**
```cypher
# See all node labels
CALL db.labels() YIELD label RETURN label;

# See all relationship types
CALL db.relationshipTypes() YIELD relationshipType RETURN relationshipType;

# Count all nodes
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);

# See sample data (first 25 nodes)
MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 25;

# See user concepts
MATCH (c:Concept) RETURN c LIMIT 10;

# See memories and relationships
MATCH (m:Memory)-[r]->(c:Concept) RETURN m, r, c LIMIT 10;
```

**Option C: Command Line (if neo4j client installed)**
```bash
# If you have cypher-shell installed
cypher-shell -a bolt://localhost:7687 -u neo4j -p yourpassword
```

### **Quick Data Check Commands:**

**See if data is being created:**
```bash
# Check Weaviate objects
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/v1/objects?limit=5" | jq '.objects | length'

# Check Neo4j nodes  
echo "MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);" | cypher-shell -a bolt://localhost:7687 -u neo4j -p yourpassword
```

**Expected to see:**
- **Weaviate**: UserMemory, ConversationChunk, UserConcept, UserArtifact objects
- **Neo4j**: User, Memory, Concept nodes with relationships

The data should start appearing after you have meaningful conversations with Dot (the IngestionAnalyst creates memories when conversations are deemed "memory-worthy").
