# Cycle Failure Analysis: 501e4303-d7af-4475-9dec-f8f30aefb9bf

## Executive Summary

**Cycle ID:** `501e4303-d7af-4475-9dec-f8f30aefb9bf`  
**Status:** `failed`  
**User:** `dev-user-123`  
**Started:** `2025-10-29 15:44:10.251`  
**Failed:** `2025-10-29 15:44:46` (after ~36 seconds)

## Root Cause

The cycle failed during the **Foundation Stage** due to **Gemini API 503 Service Unavailable errors**. Both retry attempts failed with the same error, causing the entire cycle to fail.

## Detailed Failure Timeline

### Stage 1: Foundation Stage Execution
```
15:44:10 - Cycle created
15:44:12 - Foundation Stage LLM call initiated (Attempt 1/2)
15:44:12 - Gemini API call started
15:44:38 - Attempt 1 failed: 503 Service Unavailable (after ~26 seconds)
15:44:39 - Retry logic activated, "switched" to fallback model
15:44:40 - Foundation Stage LLM call initiated (Attempt 2/2)
15:44:46 - Attempt 2 failed: 503 Service Unavailable (after ~6 seconds)
15:44:46 - Foundation Stage failed, cycle marked as failed
```

### LLM Interactions (from `llm_interactions` table)

| `adc5e82f-4bc8-4af9-a30e-631b001d4604` | 1 | error | `[503 Service Unavailable] The model is overloaded` | 26,751ms |
| `9e948525-9100-44cd-9d3c-b458ccc88825` | 2 | error | `[503 Service Unavailable] The model is overloaded` | 34,398ms |

## Technical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Fallback Model Not Actually Switching

**Problem:** The retry logic claims to "switch to fallback model" but actually reinitializes with the **same model** (`gemini-2.5-flash`).

**Evidence from Logs:**
```
üîÑ LLMChatTool - Retryable error detected, attempting to switch to fallback model...
üîÑ LLMChatTool - Switched to fallback model: gemini-2.5-flash
```

**Root Cause:** In `LLMChatTool.forceReinitialize()`:
```typescript
public forceReinitialize(): void {
  this.initialized = false;
  this.model = null;
  this.currentModelName = null;
  this.initialize(); // ‚ùå No fallback model passed!
}
```

The `initialize()` method is called without a `modelOverride` parameter, so it uses the same model from `EnvironmentModelConfigService` again.

**Expected Behavior:** Should switch to a different model like `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (as configured in the fallback).

### Issue 2: Retry Logic Limitations

**Current Implementation:**
- Maximum 2 attempts (primary + 1 fallback)
- Exponential backoff: 1 second delay before retry
- No actual model switch happening

**Impact:**
- When Gemini API is overloaded, retrying with the same model only wastes time
- If the model is truly overloaded, both attempts will fail with 503 errors
- No differentiation between model-level failures vs. API-level failures

### Issue 3: Error Propagation

**Failure Chain:**
1. `FoundationStageTool.execute()` throws `FoundationStageError`
2. `InsightWorkflowOrchestrator.executeFoundationStage()` catches and re-throws
3. `InsightWorkflowOrchestrator.executeUserCycle()` catches and logs detailed error
4. Cycle marked as `failed` in database

**Error Message:**
```
Foundation stage execution failed: LLM call failed: Failed to get a response after 2 attempts.
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes

1. **Implement Proper Fallback Model Switching**
   - Modify `LLMChatTool.forceReinitialize()` to accept a fallback model parameter
   - Use `EnvironmentModelConfigService.getFallbackModel()` if available
   - Or hardcode fallback to `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` for retries

2. **Increase Retry Attempts During API Overloads**
   - Consider 3-4 attempts instead of 2 when encountering 503 errors
   - Implement longer exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
   - Add jitter to avoid thundering herd

3. **Add Better Error Handling**
   - Differentiate between model-specific failures vs. API-wide failures
   - If multiple users report 503s, pause new cycles temporarily
   - Log API health metrics for monitoring

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Fallback Model Configuration**
   - Ensure `EnvironmentModelConfigService` provides a proper fallback chain
   - Test fallback model actually works before using it

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Track API failure rates
   - Temporarily disable cycles if error rate exceeds threshold
   - Automatically recover when API health improves

3. **Better Monitoring**
   - Alert on high 503 error rates
   - Track cycle failure rates
   - Dashboard for API health metrics

## Database Records

### User Cycle
```sql
SELECT cycle_id, user_id, status, created_at, ended_at, type 
FROM user_cycles 
WHERE cycle_id = '501e4303-d7af-4475-9dec-f8f30aefb9bf';

-- Result: status = 'failed', ended_at = NULL
```

### LLM Interactions
```sql
SELECT interaction_id, status, error_message, request_started_at, request_completed_at 
FROM llm_interactions 
WHERE worker_job_id = '501e4303-d7af-4475-9dec-f8f30aefb9bf';

-- Result: 2 interactions, both with 503 errors
```

## Conclusion

This cycle failed due to **external API issues** (Gemini API overload) combined with **insufficient fallback logic** (same model retry instead of actual model switch). The failure is **transient** and **retryable** - the cycle should succeed if retried when the API is healthy, but the current retry mechanism doesn't actually switch models, making it less effective during overload periods.
