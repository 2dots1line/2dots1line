# üîß **MAJOR CHANGES & REFACTORING PROTOCOLS - 2D1L**
*Safe procedures for architectural changes, major refactoring, and system updates*

---

## üéØ **CORE PRINCIPLES FOR MAJOR CHANGES**

> *Major changes require systematic validation at every step. The goal is to make large changes through small, verifiable increments while maintaining system stability.*

### **üß¨ FUNDAMENTAL RULES**

1. **INCREMENTAL COMPLEXITY** - Change one variable at a time, test immediately
2. **SYSTEMATIC VALIDATION** - Verify each step before proceeding to next
3. **ROLLBACK READINESS** - Always have a clear path back to working state
4. **CATEGORICAL IMPACT ANALYSIS** - Understand all systems affected by changes
5. **INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY UPDATE** - Document new patterns discovered

---

## üìã **PRE-CHANGE PREPARATION PROTOCOL**

### **üîç CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

**BEFORE any major change, document:**
```bash
# 1. CURRENT WORKING STATE
git status
pnpm health:check
pnpm services:status
pnpm build  # Verify everything works

# 2. CHANGE SCOPE ANALYSIS
echo "What components will be affected:"
echo "- Packages: [list]"
echo "- Services: [list]" 
echo "- Configuration files: [list]"
echo "- Database schema: [yes/no]"
echo "- API contracts: [yes/no]"

# 3. DEPENDENCY CHAIN IMPACT
echo "What depends on components being changed:"
grep -r "import.*from.*[component-name]" packages/ services/ apps/
```

### **üö® RISK MITIGATION SETUP**

**Create safety nets:**
```bash
# 1. BACKUP CURRENT STATE
git add . && git commit -m "checkpoint: before [change description]"
git tag "checkpoint-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"

# 2. DOCUMENT ROLLBACK PLAN
echo "Rollback procedure if change fails:"
echo "1. git reset --hard [checkpoint-tag]"
echo "2. pnpm install"
echo "3. cd packages/database && pnpm db:generate"
echo "4. pnpm build"

# 3. PREPARE VALIDATION TESTS
echo "Validation criteria after change:"
echo "- All packages build successfully"
echo "- All services start and pass health checks"
echo "- Critical workflows still function"
echo "- No new TypeScript/build conflicts"
```

### **‚öôÔ∏è ENVIRONMENT STABILIZATION**

**Ensure clean starting point:**
```bash
# 1. CLEAN CONFLICT ARTIFACTS
pnpm fix:conflicts

# 2. VERIFY NO EXISTING ISSUES
find . -name "pnpm-lock*.yaml" | wc -l  # Should be 1
find . -name "*tsbuildinfo*" -not -path "./node_modules/*" -not -name "*.json" | wc -l  # Should be 0

# 3. BASELINE PERFORMANCE
time pnpm build  # Record baseline build time
```

---

## üîÑ **INCREMENTAL CHANGE METHODOLOGY**

### **üéØ ATOMIC CHANGE PROTOCOL**

**For each incremental change:**

1. **MAKE MINIMAL CHANGE**
   ```bash
   # Change ONE thing only
   # Examples: 
   # - Rename single file
   # - Update single dependency
   # - Modify single configuration
   # - Add single new feature
   ```

2. **IMMEDIATE VALIDATION**
   ```bash
   # Test affected component immediately
   cd [affected-package] && pnpm build
   
   # Check for immediate errors
   npx tsc --noEmit --project [affected-package]
   ```

3. **DEPENDENCY IMPACT CHECK**
   ```bash
   # Test components that depend on change
   for pkg in packages/* services/*; do
     if grep -q "[changed-component]" "$pkg/package.json" "$pkg/tsconfig.json" 2>/dev/null; then
       echo "Testing dependent: $pkg"
       cd "$pkg" && pnpm build && cd ../..
     fi
   done
   ```

4. **INTEGRATION VERIFICATION**
   ```bash
   # Test system integration
   pnpm build  # Full system build
   pnpm services:restart  # If services affected
   
   # Test critical paths
   curl -f http://localhost:3001/api/health
   ```

5. **COMMIT INCREMENTAL PROGRESS**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "step: [specific change made]"
   ```

### **üö® FAILURE RECOVERY PROTOCOL**

**If any step fails:**

```bash
# 1. IMMEDIATE STOP
echo "‚ùå FAILURE DETECTED - STOPPING CHANGES"

# 2. ANALYZE FAILURE MODE
echo "Failure type:"
echo "- Build error: [details]"
echo "- Runtime error: [details]"  
echo "- Integration failure: [details]"

# 3. DECISION POINT
echo "Options:"
echo "A) Quick fix and continue"
echo "B) Rollback this step"
echo "C) Rollback entire change"

# 4. ROLLBACK IF NEEDED
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Rollback last step
# OR
git reset --hard [checkpoint-tag]  # Rollback entire change
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE CHANGE PROTOCOLS**

### **üîß MONOREPO STRUCTURE CHANGES**

**Adding new packages:**
```bash
# 1. CREATE PACKAGE STRUCTURE
mkdir -p packages/[new-package]/src
cd packages/[new-package]

# 2. APPLY STANDARD CONFIGURATION
# Copy package.json template
# Copy tsconfig.json template with explicit tsBuildInfoFile
# Add to workspace references

# 3. UPDATE DEPENDENCY CHAIN

# Add to relevant package dependencies

# 4. VALIDATE INTEGRATION
cd ../.. && pnpm build
```

**Moving/restructuring packages:**
```bash
# 1. UPDATE ALL REFERENCES FIRST
grep -r "old-package-name" packages/ services/ apps/
# Update all import statements
# Update all package.json dependencies
# Update all tsconfig.json references

# 2. MOVE PACKAGE
mv packages/old-name packages/new-name

# 3. UPDATE CONFIGURATION

```

### **üîÑ SERVICE ARCHITECTURE CHANGES**

**Modifying service interfaces:**
```bash
# 1. VERSION API ENDPOINTS
# Keep old endpoints working
# Add new endpoints with versioning
# Update API Gateway routing

# 2. UPDATE SHARED TYPES
cd packages/shared-types
# Add new types alongside old ones
# Don't remove old types until migration complete

# 3. GRADUAL MIGRATION
# Update services one at a time
# Test each service individually
# Test service integration

# 4. CLEANUP AFTER VERIFICATION
# Remove old endpoints
# Remove deprecated types
# Clean up unused imports
```

### **üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE SCHEMA CHANGES**

**Schema migrations:**
```bash
# 1. CREATE MIGRATION
cd packages/database
npx prisma migrate dev --name [migration-description]

# 2. UPDATE TYPES
pnpm db:generate

# 3. TEST MIGRATION

## üß™ **TESTING & VALIDATION FRAMEWORKS**

### **üîç COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

**After major changes, verify:**

```bash
# 1. BUILD SYSTEM HEALTH
pnpm clean && pnpm build
# Should complete without errors

# 2. DEPENDENCY INTEGRITY
turbo run build --dry-run
# Should show correct dependency graph

# 3. SERVICE INTEGRATION
pnpm services:restart
pnpm services:status
# All services should be healthy

# 4. TYPE SYSTEM CONSISTENCY
find packages/ services/ -name "*.ts" -exec npx tsc --noEmit {} \;
# No TypeScript errors

# 5. RUNTIME FUNCTIONALITY
# Test critical user workflows
# Verify database operations
# Check API endpoints
# Test frontend interactions

# 6. PERFORMANCE IMPACT
time pnpm build
# Compare to baseline time

# 7. CONFLICT ARTIFACTS
pnpm health:check
# Should show no conflicts
```

### **üìä REGRESSION TESTING PROTOCOL**

**Test scenarios that commonly break:**
```bash
# 1. IMAGE UPLOAD WORKFLOW
# Upload test image via web app
# Verify appears in database
# Check Google Vision analysis works

# 2. CONVERSATION FLOW
# Send message via web app
# Verify response generated
# Check conversation recorded in database

# 3. SERVICE ORCHESTRATION
pnpm services:stop
pnpm services:start
# All services should start cleanly

# 4. BUILD SYSTEM ROBUSTNESS
rm -rf node_modules packages/*/dist services/*/dist
pnpm install && pnpm build
# Should rebuild from scratch successfully
```

---

## üìö **CHANGE DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOLS**

### **üß† INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY UPDATE**

**After successful major change:**

1. **DOCUMENT NEW PATTERNS**
   ```markdown
   ## Change: [Description]
   **Date**: [Date]
   **Scope**: [What was changed]
   **Impact**: [What systems were affected]
   **Lessons**: [What was learned]
   **Prevention**: [How to avoid issues in future]
   ```

2. **UPDATE PREVENTION SYSTEMS**
   ```bash
   # Add new health checks if needed
   # Update conflict detection scripts
   # Enhance validation protocols
   # Update TypeScript configuration templates
   ```

3. **REFINE PROCEDURES**
   ```bash
   # What worked well in this change?
   # What caused unexpected issues?
   # What could be automated next time?
   # What documentation needs updating?
   ```

### **üîÑ KNOWLEDGE PROPAGATION**

**Share insights with future agents:**

1. **Update Critical Lessons** - Add new failure modes discovered
2. **Enhance Frameworks** - Improve systematic thinking protocols  
3. **Automate Prevention** - Add new checks to health monitoring
4. **Document Patterns** - Record architectural decisions made

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH-RISK CHANGE PROTOCOLS**

### **üö® DEPENDENCY VERSION UPDATES**

**EXTREME CAUTION required:**
```bash
# 1. ONE DEPENDENCY AT A TIME
# Update single dependency
# Test that change individually
# Reinstall and verify binaries work

# 2. NEVER BULK UPDATE
# Don't use pnpm update --latest without testing
# Don't update multiple versions simultaneously
# Don't skip testing after version changes

# 3. MANDATORY VERIFICATION
pnpm install  # Reinstall everything
npx tsc --version  # Verify tooling works
pnpm build  # Test builds still work
```

### **üîß TYPESCRIPT CONFIGURATION CHANGES**

**Configuration inheritance can create silent conflicts:**
```bash
# 1. DOCUMENT CURRENT WORKING CONFIG
cp tsconfig.json tsconfig.json.backup
cp packages/*/tsconfig.json packages/*/tsconfig.json.backup

# 2. MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES
# Change one setting at a time
# Test both individual and integration behavior  

# 3. TEST RUNTIME IMPORTS
cd services/dialogue-service && node -e "require('@2dots1line/database')"
# Verify runtime works, not just compilation

# 4. CHECK MODULE BOUNDARIES
# Test cross-package imports work
# Verify frontend/backend module systems compatible
```
