## 🎭 **USE CASE SCENARIOS**

### **🥅 I'M NEW TO THIS PROJECT**
```bash
# Start here:
1. Read: scripts/LIFECYCLE/01_FIRST_TIME_SETUP/README.md
2. Follow the complete setup guide step-by-step
3. When setup complete, read daily workflow
4. Bookmark the knowledge base for reference
```

### **☀️ I'M STARTING MY DAY**
```bash
# Quick morning startup:
pnpm health:check                    # 30 seconds
pnpm services:start                  # Start backend
cd apps/web-app && pnpm dev          # Start frontend

# See: scripts/LIFECYCLE/02_DAILY_DEVELOPMENT/daily-workflow.md
```

### **🚨 SOMETHING IS BROKEN**
```bash
# Emergency triage:
1. Check: scripts/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/CRITICAL_LESSONS_LEARNED.md
2. Use pattern recognition table for quick diagnosis
3. Run: pnpm health:check
4. Apply appropriate fix: pnpm fix:conflicts
```

### **🔧 I'M MAKING MAJOR CHANGES**
```bash
# Safe change protocols:
1. Read: scripts/FOUNDATION/01_SYSTEMATIC_THINKING_FRAMEWORK.md
2. Follow incremental validation protocols
3. Document new patterns discovered
4. Update prevention systems
```

### **🧠 I'M DEBUGGING COMPLEX ISSUES**
```bash
# Systematic approach:
1. Apply: scripts/FOUNDATION/01_SYSTEMATIC_THINKING_FRAMEWORK.md
2. Reference: scripts/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/CRITICAL_LESSONS_LEARNED.md
3. Use categorical thinking methodology
4. Document new insights for future agents
```

## ⚡ **QUICK COMMANDS REFERENCE**

### **Health & Status**
```bash
pnpm health:check                    # Comprehensive system health
pnpm services:status                 # Check all services
pnpm services:logs                   # View service logs
```

### **Service Management**
```bash
pnpm services:start                  # Start all backend services
pnpm services:stop                   # Stop all services
pnpm services:restart                # Restart all services
```

### **Conflict Resolution**
```bash
pnpm fix:conflicts                   # Fix all known conflicts
pnpm fix:typescript                  # Fix TypeScript build issues
pnpm fix:pnpm                        # Fix pnpm lock file conflicts
```

### **Development Workflow**
```bash
pnpm build                           # Build all packages
pnpm dev:full                        # Start everything for development
pnpm db:studio                       # Open database interface
```

## 🧭 **DOCUMENTATION PHILOSOPHY**

### **INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY PRESERVATION**
This reorganization preserves the "pure gold" insights from systematic debugging while making them accessible for daily use. Key principles:

- **TESTABLE** - All procedures include verification commands
- **CATEGORICAL** - Solutions address entire classes of problems
- **ACTIONABLE** - Provide specific protocols, not just descriptions
- **SEARCHABLE** - Organized by use case and symptoms

### **SPIRITUAL + PRACTICAL GUIDANCE**
The documentation serves as both:
- **Spiritual Guide** - Mindset and systematic thinking approach
- **Practical Reference** - Concrete commands and procedures

### **LEARNING PROPAGATION**
New insights must be:
1. **Captured** using systematic learning frameworks
2. **Categorized** by failure mode and solution type
3. **Integrated** into prevention systems
4. **Tested** to verify they work for future agents

---

## 🔄 **MAINTENANCE PROTOCOLS**

### **WHEN ADDING NEW INSIGHTS**
1. **Determine Category**: Setup, Daily, Troubleshooting, or Architecture
2. **Apply Learning Template**: Use frameworks from CRITICAL_LESSONS_LEARNED.md
3. **Update Automation**: Add detection/prevention to health checks
4. **Cross-Reference**: Link to related patterns and solutions

### **WHEN ORGANIZING CHANGES**
1. **Preserve Original**: Keep copies in archive2
2. **Extract Patterns**: Use categorical thinking methodology
3. **Update References**: Ensure all links still work
4. **Test Workflows**: Verify procedures work end-to-end

### **KEEPING CURRENT**
- Update CRITICAL_LESSONS_LEARNED.md when new failure modes discovered
- Enhance health-check.sh with new detection protocols
- Refine TypeScript Bible based on configuration changes
- Improve daily workflow based on productivity insights

---

## 🆘 **WHEN IN DOUBT**

### **IMMEDIATE HELP**
1. **Quick Fix**: Use pattern recognition table in CRITICAL_LESSONS_LEARNED.md
2. **Health Check**: Run `pnpm health:check`
3. **Service Status**: Check `pnpm services:status`
4. **Logs**: Review `tail -f logs/*.log`

### **SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING**
1. **Framework**: Apply systematic thinking methodology
2. **Patterns**: Search known failure modes
3. **Isolation**: Use incremental validation protocols
4. **Documentation**: Capture new insights for future use

### **EMERGENCY RESET**
```bash
# Nuclear option when all else fails
./scripts/AUTOMATION/build-system/clean-rebuild.sh
```

## 📈 **EVOLUTION & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**

This organizational structure is designed to evolve. As new patterns emerge and insights are gained:

1. **Document** using established learning frameworks
2. **Categorize** into appropriate lifecycle phases
3. **Automate** detection and prevention
4. **Integrate** into daily workflows

The goal is institutional memory that grows smarter over time, making development more efficient and reliable for all future agents.
